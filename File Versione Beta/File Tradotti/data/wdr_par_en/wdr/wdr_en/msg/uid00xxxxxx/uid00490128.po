"Since we couldn't nab him on that front, we wanted to get him on other "

msgctxt "632_Araseki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Araseki"
msgid ""
"They figured if he lost his job, he'd have to pull some petty jobs to stay "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Saejima"
msgid "So he really was a workin' stiff, wearin' a suit and tie?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Araseki"
msgid ""
"Sure was. And he couldn't tell his wife why he got fired. He kept it from "

msgctxt "680_Araseki"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Araseki"
msgid ""
