msgstr ""

msgctxt "232_Info Booth Employee"

"Momoe-chan's 29 years old, with a hefty pair of Ds! She's got that real "

msgctxt "256_Info Booth Employee"

"Noriko-chan is 25, and's a real perky little gal. She's got B-cups, along "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "292_Shinada"
msgid ""
"There is that, but he's a pretty twisted guy. An older girl who's new to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "304_Takasugi"

msgctxt "328_Info Booth Employee"

msgctxt "340_Info Booth Employee"
msgid "Noriko-chan's at Boom and Bust, north on Kumano Boulevard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "352_Shinada"
msgid "Thanks. Now, which one should I go to?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "412_Attendant"
msgid "Welcome! Oh, hey, Shinada-san. What are you doing here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "424_Shinada"
msgid "Oh, ah, no, it's nothing! Nothing at all! I'll see you later!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "436_Shinada"

msgctxt "460_Attendant"
msgid "Welcome! Oh, hey, Shinada. What are you doing here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "472_Shinada"
msgid "Well, I haven't been to a cabaret club in a while. What's good nowadays?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "484_Attendant"
msgid "Oh, Club Eden is where it's at, hands down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "496_Shinada"
msgid "The one over on Kumano Boulevard? I haven't been there in a while."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "508_Attendant"
msgid ""
"I can imagine. The place is so gorgeous, I'm not sure you're really suited "
"for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "520_Shinada"
msgid "Let's head over!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "544_Attendant"
msgid "Um, Shinada-san, your friend looks rather a bit... concerned."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "556_Shinada"
msgid "Oh, yes, right! Sorry about that. I'll be back later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "568_Attendant"
msgid "Seriously?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "592_Attendant"
msgid "You sure? You know you can't put this on a tab, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "604_Shinada"
msgid "It's fine, honest!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "616_Attendant"
msgid "Okay, okay. I'll check with the club now. Give me a moment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "640_Attendant"
msgid "Hi, this is Takagi from MayNavi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "652_Attendant"
msgid "Yes, well, I have a guest here who'd like to stop by."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "664_Attendant"
msgid "Is now a good time? All right, thank you very much."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "700_Attendant"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "760_Attendant"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "772_Shinada"
msgid "I'll be back. For real this time!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "784_Attendant"
msgid "Sure, thanks, buddy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "796_Attendant"
msgid "Hey, don't just take everything I say and put it in your magazine, okay?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "808_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Since your time in the club is limited, do your best to make yourself as "
"appealing as you can to the hostess in question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "820_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If all you do is make her talk, she's likely to get bored of you quite "
"quickly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "832_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You'd be better off visiting various establishments around town, to pick up "
"on local gossip. That way you'll have plenty of things to talk about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "844_Player"
msgid "Ah, okay. Yeah, guys who've been around have a lot more to talk about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "856_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Indeed. And if talking isn't doing the trick, you could always try spending "
"more money."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "868_Player"
msgid "Like ordering more expensive drinks?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "880_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Precisely. You could also give the lady presents to increase her favor. Oh, "
"and putting in a little extra effort into how you dress never hurts either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "892_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you're willing to spend the money, you're likely to get a return on your "
"investment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "904_Player"
msgid "So basically if you're cheap, you're a scumbag."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "916_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Usually, yes. It is important to be able to get a hostess the very best "
"drink you can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "928_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Spending big amounts of cash can win a girl over in a surprisingly short "
"period of time, so if you're in a hurry, try saving up some money."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "940_Player"
msgid ""
"But if you're good at holding a conversation, you won't need to spend all "
"that money, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "952_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Correct. If you don't want to spend a great deal of money, it is advisable "
"to find other ways to get the lady to like you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "964_Player"
msgid "Thanks. I got the gist."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "976_Attendant"
msgid "Oh, right! There's one more important thing I forgot to mention."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "988_Attendant"
msgid "If things are going really well, it can be a good idea to take your leave."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1000_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you keep prattling on after that, you risk killing the mood and undoing "
"all the hard work you did."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1012_Player"
msgid ""
"Hey, that is good to know. At this point, I'm happy to save even a single "
"yen!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1024_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Lastly, before you leave, be sure to ask her if she'd like to go out with "
"you on a date later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1036_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Taking a hostess on a date can further increase her fondness for you, "
"especially if you are able to work the right magic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1048_Player"
msgid "That's good advice. You've been very helpful. Thank you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1060_Attendant"
msgid "Do you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1072_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You can invite hostesses out to join you on dates. During these you can "
"grab a bite to eat, go shopping, or play games together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1084_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Taking them out on dates will increase their affection towards you, so "
"you've got nothing to lose by asking them out when you visit the club."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1096_Player"
msgid "But asking a girl out doesn't mean she'll definitely say yes, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1108_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Correct. Whether she takes you up on your offer or not depends largely on "
"her mood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1120_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you're not good enough friends with her, she'll most likely reject your "
"proposal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1132_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If that's the case, then try to improve her mood. It's important for her to "
"have a good time as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1144_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Also, if you show up at the club and ask her out right away, you're "
"probably not going to get a very positive response either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1156_Player"
msgid "Got it. So timing is important."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1168_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Oh, yes. But if she turns you down, don't give up. If you keep on asking, "
"she may eventually give in and say yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1180_Player"
msgid "I'll try to remember that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1192_Attendant"
msgid "Do you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1204_Attendant"
msgid "Oh, I wouldn't possibly know anything about that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1216_Player"
msgid "Come on..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1228_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Okay, wait, I have something! Once you've talked your hostess up as much as "
"you can, you normally wouldn't need to order anything else for the "
"remainder of your time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1240_Attendant"
msgid ""
"However, if you order something anyway, she might treat you to a... "
"different sort of hospitality."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1252_Player"
msgid "Huh? What's that mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1264_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You knooow, things like hand-feeding you pieces of fruit, maybe some fun "
"and naughty things with candies or desserts..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1276_Player"
msgid "Aww yeah, that sounds nice!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1288_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Indeed, it is the pinnacle of excess. One of the finer thrills that money "
"well spent can buy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1300_Attendant"
msgid "Do you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1312_Attendant"
msgid "Do you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1324_Attendant"
msgid "Ah, Shinada-san. Did things go okay over at Club Eden?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1336_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Oh, it went more than okay! In fact, I'm probably gonna be going there an "
"awful lot from now on!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1348_Attendant"
msgid "Just remember they won't run a tab, so be careful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1360_Attendant"
msgid "What else can I help you with today?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1372_Attendant"
msgid "Welcome! What are you in the mood for today, sir?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1384_Kiryu"
msgid "I'm good for right now, actually."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1396_Attendant"
msgid "All right, then. Please do come again!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1408_Attendant"
msgid "Welcome! What are you in the mood for today, sir?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1420_Saejima"
msgid "Nah, I'm good for now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1432_Attendant"
msgid "All right, then. Please do come again!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1444_Attendant"
msgid "Welcome! What are you in the mood for today, sir?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1456_Akiyama"
msgid "I'm okay for now, thanks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1468_Attendant"
msgid "All right, then. Please do come again!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1480_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Welcome!\r\n"
"Wait, what... Ah! What are you doing here!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1492_Haruka"
msgid "Oh, sorry! I don't need anything! I'll just be on my way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1504_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Sheesh, I almost had a panic attack! I'd get arrested if I tried to take "
