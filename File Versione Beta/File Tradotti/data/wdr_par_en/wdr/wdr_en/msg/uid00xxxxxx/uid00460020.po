msgctxt "276_Attendant"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Attendant"
msgid "Is there anything you'd like to know more about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Since your time in the club is limited, do your best to make yourself as "
"appealing as you can to the hostess in question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "636_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If all you do is make her talk, she's likely to get bored of you quite "
"quickly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "648_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You'd be better off visiting various establishments around town, to pick up "
"on local gossip. That way you'll have plenty of things to talk about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "660_Player"
msgid "Right. People who get out often are going to have more things to talk about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "672_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Indeed. And if talking isn't doing the trick, you could always try spending "
"more money."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "684_Player"
msgid "Like ordering more expensive liquor?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "696_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Precisely. You could also give the lady presents to increase her favor. Oh, "
"and putting in a little extra effort into how you dress never hurts either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "708_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you're willing to spend the money, you're likely to get a return on your "
"investment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "720_Player"
msgid "Guys who are cheap aren't well-liked, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "732_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Not usually, no. It is important to be able to get a hostess the very best "
"drink you can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "744_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Spending big amounts of cash can win a girl over in a surprisingly short "
"period of time, so if you're in a hurry, try saving up some money."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Player"
msgid ""
"So if you're a good conversationalist, you don't need to spend as much "
"money, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "768_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Correct. If you don't want to spend a great deal of money, it is advisable "
"to find other ways to get the lady to like you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Player"
msgid "Thanks. I think I get it now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Attendant"
msgid "Oh, right! There's one more important thing I forgot to mention."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Attendant"
msgid "If things are going really well, it can be a good idea to take your leave."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you keep prattling on after that, you risk killing the mood and undoing "
"all the hard work you did."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Player"
msgid "That's good to keep in mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Lastly, before you leave, be sure to ask her if she'd like to go out with "
"you on a date later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Taking a hostess on a date can further increase her fondness for you, "
"especially if you are able to work the right magic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_Player"
msgid "I see. You've been very helpful. Thanks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Attendant"
msgid "Do you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You can invite hostesses out to join you on dates. During these you can "
"grab a bite to eat, go shopping, or play games together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Taking them out on dates will increase their affection towards you, so "
"you've got nothing to lose by asking them out when you visit the club."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Player"
msgid ""
"But just because you ask her out, it doesn't necessarily mean she'll say "
"yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "924_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Correct. Whether she takes you up on your offer or not depends largely on "
"her mood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you're not good enough friends with her, she'll most likely reject your "
"proposal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If that's the case, then try to improve her mood. It's important for her to "
"have a good time as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "960_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Also, if you show up at the club and ask her out right away, you're "
"probably not going to get a very positive response either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "972_Player"
msgid "I see. The timing is important, then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "984_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Oh, yes. But if she turns you down, don't give up. If you keep on asking, "
"she may eventually give in and say yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "996_Player"
msgid "I'll keep that in mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1008_Attendant"
msgid "Do you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1020_Attendant"
msgid "Oh, I wouldn't possibly know anything about that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1032_Player"
msgid "Oh. Too bad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1044_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Okay, wait, I have something! Once you've talked your hostess up as much as "
"you can, you normally wouldn't need to order anything else for the "
"remainder of your time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1056_Attendant"
msgid ""
"However, if you order something anyway, she might treat you to a... "
"different sort of hospitality."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1068_Player"
msgid "A different sort of hospitality? Meaning what, exactly?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1080_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You knooow, things like hand-feeding you pieces of fruit, maybe some fun "
"and naughty things with candies or desserts..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1092_Player"
msgid "That sounds strangely appealing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1104_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Indeed, it is the pinnacle of excess. One of the finer thrills that money "
"well spent can buy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1116_Attendant"
msgid "Do you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1128_Attendant"
msgid "Oh! How did things go?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1140_Kiryu"
msgid "You remember me?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1152_Attendant"
msgid "Of course I do! And I hope I'll be able to be of service to you again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1164_Attendant"
msgid "Now, what can I do for you today?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1176_Attendant"
msgid "Welcome! Can I help you find something today?"
msgstr ""
