"One, keep your eyes on the ball. Two, perfect your impact timing. And "

msgctxt "664_Shinada"
msgid "Oh, that's... kind of tricky to answer, come to think of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "676_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Think of it this way. There's a line right down the middle of the bat. If "
"you can hit a pitch on that line, that would be the sweet spot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "688_Pedro"
msgid "Okay, got it. The sweet spot is the center of the bat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "700_Shinada"
msgid ""
"That sounds about right. After this, you should go up against the machines "
"to get a better feel for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "712_Pedro"
msgid ""
"Keep eyes on the ball. Get the right timing. Hit with the sweet spot. "
"Shinaaada, I think I got it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "724_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Yeah, it sure sounds like it. If you can do those three things, you'll be "
