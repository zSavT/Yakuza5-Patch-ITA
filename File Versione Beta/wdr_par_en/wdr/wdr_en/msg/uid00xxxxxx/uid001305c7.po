msgctxt "224_Akiyama"

"Right. Considering how the Amon have operated in the past, backing out is "

msgctxt "260_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "272_Saejima"
msgid "Yeah. I'm in."

msgctxt "284_Kiryu"

msgctxt "296_Shinada"

msgctxt "320_Shinada"
msgid "So, like... I have no idea what's going on right now?"

msgctxt "344_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Ah. Come to think of it, I guess you wouldn't know about the Amon Clan, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "356_Shinada"
msgid "Nope. Hit me with some exposition. Who are these whack-jobs?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "368_Kiryu"

"Holy balls! You took on actual <Italic>assassins</Italic> and survived!? "
"How in the heck...?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "392_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"We were around the last time he got challenged, so we're pretty much a part "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "404_Shinada"
msgid ""
"So now you're on their radar, too... Man, that's nuts. Hope you guys get "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "416_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Saejima"
msgid "Mm... Well, not directly..."

msgctxt "452_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Thing is, we're down one man. Anyone remember Tanimura? What happens if he "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Kiryu"

msgctxt "476_Akiyama"

msgctxt "488_Akiyama"
msgid "......"

msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "512_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "524_Saejima"
msgid "Psh. He's probably out playin' mahjong."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "536_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Or he could be laying low after getting one of these letters. I would too, "
"if I didn't kick so much butt."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Well, if we're going by the Amon Clan's instructions, we need to get ahold "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Akiyama"
msgid "But do we really have time to be patient? My guess is no."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Saejima"
msgid "Then it's settled."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "596_Shinada"
msgid "...Uh-oh."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Saejima"
msgid "Guess this guy'll have to do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Akiyama"
msgid "I don't see any other options."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Shinada"
msgid ""
"What!? You guys must be crazy! You want <Italic>me</Italic> to fight a clan "

"right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Saejima"
msgid "Why, ya scared or somethin'?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Shinada"
msgid "Of course I'm scared－who wouldn't be!? There's no way I'm agreeing to that!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, unfortunately, you might not have a choice..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Mysterious Man"
msgid ""
"It sounds like everything is settled. Very good. A car is waiting for you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Akiyama"
msgid "See? Bit too late to be backing out now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Shinada"
msgid "Seriously? You're signing me up for a deathmatch!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Saejima"
msgid "Better sack up quick, or ya ain't gonna make it through this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Shinada"
msgid "But I can't... Kiryu-san, a little help here?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Kiryu"
msgid "Sorry, but we can't turn back now. We have to finish this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Shinada"
msgid "I don't believe it. You guys are all insane."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Mysterious Man"
msgid ""
"I assume you'll need time for preparation. Notify me when you're ready to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Shinada"
