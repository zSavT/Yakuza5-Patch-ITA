msgctxt "1092_Kiryu"

msgid "Whaddya mean?"

msgctxt "1116_Kiryu"

msgctxt "1200_Kiryu"
msgid "I guess there isn't much point in that, no. Okay, next up..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1212_Muramatsu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1224_Nakajima"

msgctxt "1236_Nakajima"

msgctxt "1248_Nakajima"
msgid "Hmm... That's weird. It ain't respondin' at all now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1260_Kiryu"
msgid "You mean it isn't doing what you tell it? That's a problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1272_Nakajima"

"Damn. Can't even shut the thing down now. Think I oughta just pull the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1284_Muramatsu"
msgid "The power plug? No, that would be dangerous. It could wreck the hard disk."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1296_Nakajima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1308_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1320_Muramatsu"

msgctxt "1464_Muramatsu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1704_Muramatsu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1740_Kiryu"
msgid "Last resort?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1752_Nakajima"
msgid "Pullin' the power cord outta the computer! That'll stop it in its tracks!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1764_Muramatsu"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1776_Nakajima"
msgid "Well, we ain't got much of a choice!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1788_Muramatsu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1920_Muramatsu"

msgctxt "1992_Hirakawa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2004_Nakajima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2016_Hirakawa"

msgctxt "2040_Hirakawa"
