msgid "I'll use the move on you so you can remember how it's done."

msgid "You ready?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Sosuke"
msgid "All right, then. Oh, before I forget..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"This is a training session, so I'll let you hit me a little. But if you get "
"carried away, I might get a little ticked off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Kiryu"
msgid "What kind of training is this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Sosuke"
msgid "Look, this isn't a dojo. I do things my own way out here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Sosuke"
msgid "Here we go!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Kiryu"
msgid "Sure, let's do this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Sosuke"
msgid "This time, we'll focus on the most basic of the basics: evasion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Sosuke"
msgid "Think of it this way. You can't lose if your opponent never hits you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Sosuke"
msgid "Then again, you'll never win if you don't go on the offensive, either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"So if you can attack while evading, you'll be unstoppable. Pretty simple, "
"huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah. The old evade and strike, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Right. The Komaki Evade & Strike to be exact. It's the perfect combination "
"of both evasion and attacking."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1196_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Of course, it has its drawbacks. You won't be able to attack at full power, "
"since you're evading at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1208_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"The idea is to evade and strike to create an opening, then follow up with "
"more attacks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1220_Sosuke"
msgid "I'll show you by using the technique on you. That's the best way to learn."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1232_Sosuke"
msgid "Okay, you ready?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1244_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1256_Sosuke"
msgid "All right, then. Oh, and like I said before..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1268_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"You'll get ticked off if I hit you too much? It's not like I'm going to "
"hold back."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1280_Sosuke"
msgid "Suit yourself. You're the one who's going to suffer if it comes to that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1292_Sosuke"
msgid "But enough talking. Let's go!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1316_Kiryu"
msgid "Sure, let's do this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1388_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Now let's go over a way to take advantage of the opening an opponent leaves "
"when he attacks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1400_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"The idea is to break through the attacker's defenses by using the momentum "
"of his attack against him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1412_Sosuke"
msgid "And to do that, you use the Komaki Parry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1424_Kiryu"
msgid "Got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1436_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Timing's everything with this one. Get it wrong, and your opponent eats "
"your lunch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1448_Sosuke"
msgid "But the only way to learn is the hard way. And by hard, I mean painful."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1460_Kiryu"
msgid "Okay. Got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1472_Sosuke"
msgid "You know the drill, old man."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1484_Sosuke"
msgid "Okay, you ready?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1496_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1508_Sosuke"
msgid "And remember, try not to get too carried away."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1520_Kiryu"
msgid "Heh, no promises."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1532_Sosuke"
msgid "It's your funeral, old man. All right, let's start!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1556_Kiryu"
msgid "Sure, let's do this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1628_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Like last time, this is another way to use the opening an opponent leaves "
"when he attacks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1640_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Even the best of the masters leave themselves exposed for just an instant "
"as they attack."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1652_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"That's when you use the Komaki Tiger Drop, a vicious move that seizes that "
"opportunity."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1664_Kiryu"
msgid "The Tiger Drop..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1676_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"If you've used it before, you'll know you only have a brief moment to pull "
"it off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1688_Sosuke"
msgid "Study your opponent's attacks so you'll know the perfect time to unleash it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1700_Kiryu"
msgid "Right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1712_Sosuke"
msgid "The Tiger Drop is not an easy move to pull off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1724_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"But for now, I'll be using it like crazy. Just remember that it takes years "
"to master."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1736_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"It's one of those high-risk, high-return moves. Always good to have one in "
"your bag of tricks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1748_Kiryu"
msgid "Got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1760_Sosuke"
msgid "Okay, you ready?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1772_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1784_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"I won't be taking it quite as easy on you this time. I won't be going all "
"out, either, of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1796_Kiryu"
msgid "Heh, save the excuses and just get to it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1808_Sosuke"
msgid "I like your style, old man. Let's go!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1832_Kiryu"
msgid "Sure, let's do this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1904_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"This time, I'll teach you something more conceptual instead of a "
"straight-up technique."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1916_Kiryu"
msgid "Conceptual?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1928_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Yeah, it's different from before where I just tell you about a move and how "
"to use it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1940_Kiryu"
msgid "I don't follow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1952_Sosuke"
msgid "You're not that good at flexible thinking, are you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1964_Sosuke"
msgid "Well, don't worry, buddy. I'm going to teach you anyway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1976_Kiryu"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1988_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"People have a way of tapping into unimaginable power when their back's "
"against the wall. What if we were able to do that at will?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2000_Kiryu"
msgid "It would be a huge advantage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2012_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"The fact that you can use Komaki style moves shows that you've trained your "
"soul, technique, and body."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2024_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"That means you should be able to tap into this off-the-charts power when "
"you're backed into a corner, just like me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2036_Kiryu"
msgid "Off-the-charts power?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2048_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"The best way to learn is by doing, so brace yourself. The kid gloves are "
"coming off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2060_Kiryu"
msgid "Got it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2072_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Remember, you have to be backed into a corner. Just let me take care of "
"that. The rest is for you to figure out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2084_Kiryu"
msgid "Finally, some real training."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2096_Sosuke"
msgid "It's all been totally real. Want to take this seriously, old man?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2108_Kiryu"
msgid "Right. Sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2120_Sosuke"
msgid "Whatever, let's get going."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2132_Sosuke"
msgid "You ready?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2144_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, let's get started."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2156_Sosuke"
msgid "Okay, let's do this!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2192_Sosuke"
msgid "Okay, you passed the test."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2204_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Knock backs are really useful in creating opportunities to attack, "
"especially against tough opponents."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2216_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"I couldn't care less if you forgot what my gramps taught, but you better "
"remember what you learned from me, old man."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2240_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"About that... I'm sensing you have a lot of hostility toward the elder "
"Komaki."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2252_Sosuke"
msgid "It's not hostility. I admit the old coot's got good stuff."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2264_Sosuke"
msgid "But he's getting old. I'm on the way up, while he's on a one-way trip down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2276_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"That makes me better than him. Wait, I take that back. I'm better than him "
"even without taking that stuff into account."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2288_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Arrogant, aren't you? Personally, I don't think your grandfather's lost "
"much of his edge."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2300_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"It doesn't matter how good you are. If you don't do anything with your "
"skill, what's the point?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2312_Kiryu"
msgid "What're you getting at?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2324_Sosuke"
msgid "Heh. Enough talk for now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2336_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"We can continue this conversation next time. That is, if you can complete "
"the training I assign you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2348_Sosuke"
msgid "Come on, old man. That was just plain sad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2360_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Let's pretend that didn't happen, okay? Come back when you're ready to be a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2432_Sosuke"
msgid "Okay, good enough. You pass."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2444_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"To use Evade & Strike right, you gotta be able to evade when needed, you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2456_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"If all you're thinking about is landing a blow, you'll be in for a world of "
"pain."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2468_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, I get it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2492_Sosuke"
msgid "But hey, you move pretty well for an old dude."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2504_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"You don't look like you play sports. So what, did you bust some heads back "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2516_Kiryu"
msgid "No comment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2528_Sosuke"
msgid ""
"Keeping your past a secret, old man? Aw, whatever. It's not like I really "

msgid "Hey, do you know how Gramps is doing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2552_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I haven't seen him in a long time, but the last time we met, he was doing "
"fine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2564_Sosuke"
msgid "Huh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2576_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"If you're so interested, why don't you just go see him yourself? He'll be "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2588_Sosuke"
msgid "A dojo in Kamurocho, huh? Figures."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2600_Sosuke"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2612_Kiryu"

msgctxt "2624_Sosuke"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2648_Sosuke"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2792_Sosuke"

"So you say, but with my overwhelming strength and good looks, you'd have to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2804_Kiryu"

"Good looks have nothing to do with it. But as long as we're on the subject, "

msgstr ""

msgid "What's that supposed to mean?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2828_Kiryu"
