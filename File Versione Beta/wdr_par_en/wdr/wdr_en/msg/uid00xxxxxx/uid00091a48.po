"About a dozen years ago, the village had a booming side business. This is "

"At the time, the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties was up for "

msgctxt "248_Nishina"
msgid ""
"They banned all hunting except that which was part of the livelihood and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "260_Nishina"
msgid ""
"But even with the exception, it was still a total ban on recreational "

msgctxt "272_Sakurai"
msgid ""
"In the months before the new law was to take effect, our mountain was "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "284_Sakurai"

"Most of them were commissioned by fur dealers and taxidermists, who were "
"hoping to nab big game before the law took effect."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "296_Nishina"
msgid ""
"But the mountain's very unforgiving in winter, as you know well by now. So "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "308_Nishina"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "320_Saejima"

"The money was good. For poor villagers like us, it was like nothing we'd "

msgctxt "344_Nishina"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "356_Nishina"

msgctxt "368_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "380_Sakurai"

msgstr ""

"We think the man whose name was recorded by authorities as \"Sato\" was one "

"he went missing..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Nishina"
msgid ""
"Possibly because he was chasing Yama-oroshi, who of course was the most "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Saejima"
msgid "Sure, he went for the jackpot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Nishina"
msgid ""
"Yeah. But Okudera－our friend－he wasn't motivated by the almighty dollar. He "
"risked his life to protect the village from Yama-oroshi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Nishina"
msgid ""
"And after it was all over, he didn't even boast about it. He just continued "
"to live quietly as a hunter. In truth... he made us all remember how a "
"hunter should live."
msgstr ""

"Okudera-san is truer to the spirit of the hunt than any of us native "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "488_Nishina"
