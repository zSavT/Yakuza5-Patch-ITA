"It's a little expensive, sure. Even though they're high quality, the price "

msgctxt "156_Hinata"

msgctxt "180_Hinata"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "192_Player"
msgid ""
"Well, by making the price higher they're limiting the number of people who "

msgctxt "216_Hinata"

"It's important to be noticed. You can't let yourself be satisfied with "

"There's a lot of attention paid to even the smallest of details. You'll see "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "348_Hinata"

"After all, if you need a salesperson to explain the details of a product "

msgctxt "372_Player"

"That could be true. But it also gives you something to talk about. Some "

msgctxt "384_Hinata"

"That's still kinda lame. What's the point in buying designer label products "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "396_Player"
