msgctxt "444_Coach Igarashi"

msgctxt "468_Coach Igarashi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "480_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Do you know why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "492_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Because it's impossible to improve on things you haven't noticed about "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "504_Shinada"
msgid "Kinda like correcting a bad habit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "516_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Yup. At present, you only have a subjective awareness of yourself as a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "528_Coach Igarashi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "540_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"To prevent that, I can objectively identify and train the areas in which "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "564_Coach Igarashi"

msgctxt "624_Shinada"

msgctxt "660_Coach Igarashi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Shinada"
