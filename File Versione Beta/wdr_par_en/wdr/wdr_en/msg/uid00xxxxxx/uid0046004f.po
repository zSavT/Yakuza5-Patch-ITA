"Hm. You could be anyone for all I know. I'm betting I can still turn you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "140_Private Investigator"

msgctxt "248_Private Investigator"

"It's not uncommon for influential families to conduct a background check on "

msgctxt "296_Private Investigator"

msgctxt "320_Private Investigator"

msgctxt "332_Shinada"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "344_Private Investigator"
msgid ""
"Well, technically her parents do. They've sold off their mansion and are "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "356_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Private Investigator"

"Yes, miss. And unfortunately, at this point, I'm afraid my client is likely "
