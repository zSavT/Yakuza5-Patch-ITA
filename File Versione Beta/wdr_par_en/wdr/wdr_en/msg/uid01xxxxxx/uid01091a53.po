msgid "So Okudera-han is..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "404_Nishina"
msgid ""
"We don't know for sure. He was a good member of the community. So we "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "416_Nishina"
msgid "But ever since, we hunters have kept him at arm's length."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Nishina"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Nishina"
msgid ""
"If we knew his identity, we'd have no excuse not to turn him in. And we "
"didn't want to do that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Saejima"
msgid "So ya deliberately shunned him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Saejima"
