msgctxt "248_Kiryu"

msgctxt "356_Yuya"

msgctxt "380_Kiryu"

msgctxt "392_Yuya"

msgctxt "404_Kiryu"

msgctxt "416_Yuya"

msgctxt "524_Yuya"

"I want to make a fresh start, too! It'll be like the old days, when I still "

msgctxt "548_Yuya"
msgid "First, I'll find a job. It doesn't matter what it is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Yuya"
msgid ""
"Actually, I should probably find the kind of job nobody else wants to do. A "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Kiryu"
msgid "So you won't be going back to Stardust?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "584_Yuya"
msgid "I don't think so, no."

msgctxt "596_Kiryu"
msgid ""
