msgstr ""

msgctxt "224_Shinada"
msgid "You were?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "236_Asada"

msgctxt "296_Asada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "344_Asada"

"Oh, come on. The statute of limitations has run out, hasn't it? Just admit "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "368_Asada"

msgctxt "428_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Asada"
msgid ""
"Come on. I was once a pitcher, and a Wyvern. If you can get past me, I'll "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Shinada"

msgctxt "464_Asada"
msgid "Fine by me. You're not willing to give me the time of day anyhow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "476_Asada"

"Besides, we're both former pros. I think I can learn a lot more from "

msgctxt "548_Asada"

"Only ten pitches? You must be out of practice if that's all you can throw "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Asada"

"Hah, who woulda thunk it? Two former Wyverns, duking it out at a dinky "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Shinada"
msgid ""
"At least people care about <Italic>my</Italic> news. Now will you quit "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Asada"
msgid ""
"Yeah, I suppose that was the deal. Fine. Consider me a stranger. Oh, but "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Shinada"
msgid "What's this for? I gave you no such interview."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Asada"
msgid ""
"You're right. You gave me something better. I can clearly see your batting "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Asada"
msgid ""
"Even after all these years, you still kept practicing your swing, in spite "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Asada"
msgid ""
"You practice in hopes of making a comeback some day. You wouldn't bother to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Asada"

"And because you know that in your heart, you have the resolve to press on. "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Shinada"
msgid ""
"What'd you say your name was? Asada? I'd say you have more talent with a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Asada"
msgid ""
"I guess I'll take that as a compliment, but it doesn't make me happy one "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Asada"

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Shinada"
msgid "Kurosaki... Why are you still holding on to yours?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Asada"
msgid ""
"Sorry to disappoint, but I write for a small gossip paper. Our readers are "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Asada"
msgid ""
"Still, you did provide me with a lead. I'd be happy to spot you for a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Kurosaki"
msgid "What was that!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Asada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Shinada"

msgctxt "920_Shinada"
