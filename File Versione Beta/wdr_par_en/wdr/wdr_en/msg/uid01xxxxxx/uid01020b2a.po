msgctxt "104_Akiyama"
msgid "All right, you've convinced me. I'll help you out. But first..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "152_Akiyama"
msgid "Why stop the show? You said something about lives in danger?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "164_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Uh... I don't really know the details, to be honest. But Sawada said the "

msgctxt "176_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "188_Shinada"

msgctxt "224_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "248_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "260_Shinada"
msgid "That's why the only way to stop them is to cancel the concert!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "272_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"And you want 300 million to pay the cancellation fee. Man, first Katsuya, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "284_Shinada"
msgid "Oh, you mean Katsuya of Ousaka Enterprises?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "296_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Yeah. Funny thing is, both Kuroha and Ousaka are Omi Alliance. So why is "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "308_Shinada"
msgid "Infighting, you think? But why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "320_Akiyama"
msgid "Some kind of struggle over the leadership change."

"The current chairman is Kuroha, but apparently he's gonna be out of the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "344_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Kuroha might be trying to consolidate power before the chairman bites the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "356_Shinada"
msgid "Makes sense."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "368_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"It's still just conjecture. But now I get why you wanna stop the concert. "
"So..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "416_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"What's your plan for that 20 mil you said could wait until later? It better "
"not be more debt, man. You should've paid that all off when you got the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Shinada"
msgid "I don't want to do that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Akiyama"
msgid "Why not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Dojima-kun's already given me another crack at my dream. That's more than "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Shinada"
msgid "I never should have taken the twenty million yen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "476_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Wait, so you wanna go into debt again so you can return the 20 mil to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "488_Shinada"
msgid "No need to insult me..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "500_Akiyama"

msgctxt "512_Shinada"
msgid "Thanks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "524_Akiyama"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "596_Akiyama"
msgid "Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if all these events were linked somehow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Shinada"
msgid "Me neither."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Akiyama"
msgid "There's just one problem."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Akiyama"
msgid "The girl who's doing that concert－Haruka Sawamura－she's under my care."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Shinada"
msgid "What!? Are you serious!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"And unfortunately, both she and I are committed to her performing. No "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"She's actually been continuing her lessons in private with folks from her "
"agency."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"And I already turned down someone else's offer to stop the concert. And let "
"me tell you, that guy was willing to pay a lot!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Shinada"
msgid "But we have no idea how dangerous this might be!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Akiyama"
msgid "I realize the risk, but I won't give up on the show so easily."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Akiyama"
msgid "A lot of people's dreams are riding on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Shinada"
msgid "Dreams, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"That said, if we hold the event anyway, there's no guarantee the audience "
"will be safe."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"We've got to do all we can to eliminate any threats. I agree with you on "
"that front."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Shinada"
msgid "If you agreed you'd cancel the event."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Akiyama"
msgid "I can't do that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"If I did, Haruka-chan's dream would be dead－a dream that Park-san "
"sacrificed so much for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"You have to seize your dreams when you can. There might not be a second "
"chance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Akiyama"
msgid "Just like that home run of yours."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Shinada"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Akiyama"
msgid "Haruka-chan will live her dream. And I'll make sure she won't be in danger."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Shinada"
msgid "How will you do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Akiyama"
msgid "The first step is... we have to find out what they've got planned."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "920_Shinada"
msgid "How are we going to do that? We don't have any leads on the Kuroha Family."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "932_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"True. But Katsuya said he'd already talked with the event organizers about "
"canceling."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "944_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"There's no way he did that without using a ton of money, or maybe violence, "
"to put on the pressure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "956_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"How else could you nix an event at a venue like the Japan Dome? And just "
"two days in advance?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Shinada"
msgid "Unless the organizer was already in cahoots with Katsuya."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Akiyama"
msgid "Fun thought, eh? All right then, let's go play detective with Katsuya!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Now? Fine, no time like the present. So we just show up there? Do you even "
"know where he's at?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Akiyama"
msgid "His company is MAO, Inc. As for its location..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Shinada"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"No one knows where they are. Not even Yamaura-san, and she runs Dyna Chair "
"now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Shinada"
msgid "How does that happen?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"The company can be reached, but no matter what you ask, they say you have "
"to talk to the president."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064_Akiyama"
msgid "And when you ask where the president is, they say they don't know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Shinada"
msgid "That's ridiculous."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Yeah, but there's not much we can do about it. And hey, we don't have time "
"for normal avenues like that anyway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Shinada"
msgid "What's our move, then? We have to find out where that president is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Akiyama"
msgid "Yep, and we should ask the people who know this town better than anyone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Shinada"
msgid "Who?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"The homeless. I've got connections with them. I used to be homeless myself, "
"years ago."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Shinada"
msgid "Huh. Interesting circle of friends you got."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Akiyama"
msgid "You bet. Let's see who we can find."
