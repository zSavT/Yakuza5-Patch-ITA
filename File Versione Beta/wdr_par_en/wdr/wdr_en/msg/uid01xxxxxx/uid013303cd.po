msgctxt "216_Takasugi"

msgctxt "228_Shinada"

"Takasugi-san. Remember when I said I can't just hit a home run even if I "

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "252_Takasugi"

msgctxt "336_Takasugi"

msgctxt "348_Takasugi"

"Don't tell me you can somehow pinpoint the Nagoya Family through pitching "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "360_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "372_Takasugi"

msgid ""
"Manabe-san said the match fixing stopped as soon as I was banned from the "

"This data backs it up. It's like the Wyverns completely transformed after "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "408_Shinada"
msgid ""
"It might not be obvious to the untrained eye, but any weird\r\n"
"pitch selections or random bench-shuffling altogether\r\n"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "420_Takasugi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "432_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "444_Takasugi"
msgid "Can't argue there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "456_Shinada"
msgid ""
"That's not all. After my one and only game, the Wyverns completely changed "
"their roster."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "468_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Their policy used to favor local talent, but all of a sudden they went "
"after foreign players and actively engaged in trades."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "480_Takasugi"
msgid ""
"But that's the opposite of what Sakai said. Didn't he say you were "
"sacrificed to protect Nagoya?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "492_Takasugi"
msgid "What else could he mean but protecting local players?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "504_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Could be. But I think when Sakai-san mentioned Nagoya, it wasn't just about "
"our old team."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "516_Shinada"
msgid ""
"I'm thinking it's something bigger. Like something that concerns the whole "
"town."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "528_Takasugi"
msgid "All of Kineicho?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "540_Shinada"
msgid ""
"We both know this town has a dark side, but we're clueless about what "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "552_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Now, if we want to find more about the Nagoya Family, we're gonna have to "
"search beyond just baseball."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "564_Takasugi"
msgid ""
"So that scandal of yours really did change the face of this town. And "
"you're saying we get to the bottom of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Shinada"
msgid "Yeah."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "588_Takasugi"
msgid "Isn't there anyone who's in the know about these things?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Shinada"
msgid "There's a perfect guy for that. He's really well-known here in town."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Takasugi"
msgid "Who's that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Shinada"
msgid "The Chamber of Commerce chairman and esteemed local chef, Ushijima-san."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "636_Shinada"
msgid ""
"He's treated me good ever since I wound up here. Whatever kind of secret's "
