msgctxt "668_Shirakawa"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Shinada"
msgid ""

msgid "Oh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If we went into extra innings with the score knotted, you were afraid my "

msgctxt "764_Shirakawa"

msgctxt "776_Shirakawa"

msgctxt "788_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Shinada"

msgctxt "824_Shirakawa"

msgctxt "848_Shirakawa"

"I'm going back to Tokyo. I took all this time off, and the guys at the "

msgctxt "884_Shirakawa"

msgctxt "932_Shinada"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "944_Shirakawa"
msgid "Thanks!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "956_Shinada"
msgid "For what?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Shirakawa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Shirakawa"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Shirakawa"
