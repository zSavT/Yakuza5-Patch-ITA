msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_MAO President"

"Proof that I'm not lying. It's a photo of them from twenty years ago. The "

msgctxt "536_MAO President"
msgid ""
"Yeah. Enormously! See, going into management was the only way Ka-chan could "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_MAO President"
msgid ""
"And competition was too fierce in Tokyo. It was impossible for him to set "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_MAO President"
msgid ""
"So he went to Osaka, where there was still room for growth. All he needed "

msgctxt "584_Akiyama"

msgctxt "632_MAO President"
msgid ""
"Sure, they weren't stars, but it was the next best thing. And they worked "

msgctxt "656_MAO President"

msgid ""
"Pretending to be bitter rivals is a great way to generate buzz and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_MAO President"
msgid "Ah, so you remember. Yeah, Park-san asked Ka-chan to take them on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_MAO President"
msgid "She said T-Set needed some strong competition to motivate them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_MAO President"
msgid ""
"It was her idea to transfer them to Osaka Talent and make them grapple with "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_MAO President"
msgid "Haha. It's just the sort of scheme she would come up with."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I'm just... surprised that Park-san, Katsuya, and Majima-san were all "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_MAO President"
msgid "Small world, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_MAO President"
msgid "I guess Majima wasn't in touch with Park-san when she died."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_MAO President"
msgid "But he's still in contact with Ka-chan!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_MAO President"

msgctxt "812_Akiyama"
msgid "What!? So even now, Katsuya and Majima-san are..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_MAO President"
msgid "Close friends, yeah. It's nice, don't you think?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I don't get it. That means Katsuya must have some other reason for "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_MAO President"
msgid "Canceling!? I thought it was only postponed!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Akiyama"
msgid "Why do you think that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "872_MAO President"
msgid ""
"Well, because Ka-chan said he wanted it pushed back a day. Of course, I "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "884_MAO President"
msgid ""
"His reason seemed sound, though. He needed more time to work out "
