"Hmm. What a carefully worded answer. You know, I think your manager warned "

msgctxt "752_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I won't say who, but I think some of them aren't taking this work "

msgctxt "764_Masuda"

"Oho! That's the stuff I like to hear! Nobody's going to make it in this "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Masuda"
msgid ""
"I mean, it's true, isn't it? That's why you've been able to get this far. "

msgctxt "872_Haruka"

msgctxt "884_Haruka"
msgid "Yes. I do."

msgctxt "896_Masuda"

msgctxt "920_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "932_Masuda"
msgid "No comment, huh? Or do you just refuse to acknowledge T-Set's success?"

msgctxt "944_Haruka"
msgid "Oh no, that's not what I meant at all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "956_Masuda"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Haruka"
msgid ""
"It doesn't really bother me. After all, it's not like we both belonged to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Haruka"
msgid ""
"And I'm sure my agency was of the mindset that they were free to go as they "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Masuda"
msgid ""
"You're kidding me, right? Dyna Chair must've sunk a lot of money into "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Masuda"
msgid ""
"If I were the president of Dyna Chair, I'd be hoping for their downfall "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Haruka"
msgid "Well, that's not the way we think."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Masuda"
msgid "Hmm. If you say so. But it doesn't make for a very interesting interview."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I don't think that'll be true for long. I believe you have to follow a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Fair point! But, Dyna Chair never did manage to make T-Set as popular as "
"they've gotten with Osaka Talent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Now, Haruka-chan, I don't think even you can deny that Osaka Talent has "
"done a fine job of selling T-Set. It isn't at all surprising that Dyna "
"Chair would be bitter about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088_Haruka"
msgid "Um, well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Masuda"
msgid ""
"But, I guess it's really T-Set that's to blame. Their success is bound to "
"earn resentment from those below them. Whew, the idol business sure is "
"rough!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I have no objection to it whatsoever. I consider them great competition, "
"and what happened between them and my agency doesn't involve me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Well! I can see they coached you well. I was hoping you'd give me a little "
"bit more to work with."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Haruka"
msgid "I'm just saying what I feel. We're friendly rivals, and that's it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Hmm. I guess you're being cautious. To be honest, I thought I'd be able to "
"get some juicer quotes out of you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Okay, last question. I was told by T-Set's manager that Dyna Chair and "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Haruka"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1196_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Oh, you don't know? A manager of yours named Horie grabbed one of the T-Set "

"happened."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1208_Masuda"
msgid ""
"With rumors like this flying around, people are starting to say Dyna Chair "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1232_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1244_Masuda"
msgid ""
"You know, you haven't made a single comment this whole interview. Well, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1256_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Heheh. I'm gonna make a juicy article out of this! I don't suppose Dyna "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1268_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1280_Haruka"
msgid "Um..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1292_Masuda"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1304_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1316_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I'm not aware of being used as a weapon because it's not true. That much I "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1328_Masuda"
msgid "Hmm. So you're saying Horie-san didn't scream at one of the T-Set girls?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1340_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Of course he didn't. Just before that, she had tripped me. Horie-san was "
"defending me by confronting them about the incident. He wasn't screaming at "
"her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1352_Masuda"
msgid ""
"But he was certainly raising his voice in anger, wasn't he? Some would call "
"that screaming."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1364_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Plus, I heard that your claim of being \"tripped\" was really just a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1376_Haruka"
msgid "Well..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1388_Masuda"
msgid "Hehe. I think maybe Dyna Chair has a bit of a persecution complex."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1400_Masuda"
msgid ""
"But thanks for confirming the story on Horie-san. That should really spice "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1412_Haruka"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1424_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Dyna Chair isn't seeking revenge. We have a healthy rivalry, and it's "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1436_Masuda"
msgid ""
"Oh? So you're saying that Horie-san <Italic>didn't</Italic> get into an "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1448_Haruka"
msgid ""
"He did, but it had nothing to do with revenge. It was just a minor "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1460_Masuda"

msgctxt "1556_Haruka"
msgid "Hehe."

msgctxt "1568_Masuda"

"Well, I don't think I'll use that question after all. I'm sorry if I was "

msgctxt "1592_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Okay, that's the end of the interview. To be honest, I didn't get close to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1604_Haruka"
msgid "What you were after?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1616_Masuda"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1628_Masuda"
