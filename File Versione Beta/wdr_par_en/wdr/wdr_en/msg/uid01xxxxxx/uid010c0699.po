"I don't know about other parts, but here in Fukuoka, taxi drivers are "

msgctxt "248_Passenger"

msgctxt "296_Passenger"

msgctxt "308_Kiryu"
msgid "Such as?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "320_Passenger"
msgid ""
"Well, I thought we'd do some practice dialogue, help get you started. I'm "

"Business is pretty good. It helps when I get passengers like you who are "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "404_Passenger"
msgid "There you go. That's how it's done."

msgctxt "416_Kiryu"
msgid "Okay. I think I'm getting the hang of this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_SS1_M_NML_TAX_kamae"

"Business could be better. Long-distance fares like these mean my cab's "

msgctxt "440_Passenger"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_SS1_M_NML_TAX_kamae"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "536_Kiryu"
msgid "No, not really..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Passenger"
msgid ""
"Look, don't overthink it. All you have to do is think of something casual "

msgid "Uh-huh..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_SS1_M_NML_TAX_kamae"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Passenger"
msgid ""
"Yeah, it's pretty tasty, isn't it? Goes well with sake, so it's perfect for "

msgctxt "680_Kiryu"
msgid "Oh, I'll have a drink every now and then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_SS1_M_NML_TAX_kamae"
msgid "I'd have to say Hakata ramen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Passenger"
msgid ""
"Ah, Hakata ramen's a classic. Each restaurant has its own take on the "
"standard tonkotsu broth. You should try out as many different places as you "
"can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Kiryu"
msgid "I might just do that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_SS1_M_NML_TAX_kamae"
msgid "Do you even need to ask? It's gotta be takoyaki."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Passenger"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Passenger"

msgctxt "896_Passenger"
