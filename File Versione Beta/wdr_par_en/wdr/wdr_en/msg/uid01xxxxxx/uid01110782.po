msgctxt "92_Kaguya"

"Yeah! There are a whole bunch of shops here under Tsukimino! We could give "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "104_Saejima"
msgid "I haven't been down there yet. Is it really that big?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "116_Kaguya"
msgid ""
"It is. The underground walkways stretch all the way from Sapporo Station to "

"Sounds big. Glad I didn't go there then. If I did, I'm sure I woulda gotten "

"It's fine! Tsukimino is all one giant grid, and the underground is "

msgctxt "152_Saejima"
msgid "A grid, huh? Like Kyoto, then. I could probably handle that."

"But don't ya get mixed up 'cause all of the buildings look the same? It's "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "188_Kaguya"
msgid ""
"I suppose so. But don't you think the Tsukimino intersection is a pretty "
"big landmark?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "200_Saejima"
msgid "True. They've got those big ol' signs, so it stands out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "212_Saejima"
msgid "It's prettier outside. Walkin' underground is a wasted opportunity."

msgctxt "224_Kaguya"
msgid ""
"No, the underground is pretty! It's got this kind of near-future thing "
"going on. The lighting and whatnot is very chic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "236_Saejima"
msgid ""
"Hmph, I'm not interested in that sorta thing. I don't give a damn about "

msgctxt "248_Kaguya"
msgid ""
"What? But Tsukimino is made up of rows of buildings that all look the same, "
"too. Isn't  that just as boring?"

"Ain't every day you see the town blanketed in snow. Almost never happens in "

"I thought I'd get sick of seein' it over the last two years, but guess I "

"But it's not just a regular underground tunnel. There are stores lined up "

msgctxt "320_Kaguya"
msgid ""
"Most large buildings have underground floors that are connected too, so you "

msgctxt "332_Saejima"
msgid ""
"Yeah, but when I'm under Kamurocho, I dunno what leads where. Why's "
"everything between these stations even connected?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "344_Kaguya"
msgid ""
"Ah, I get you! You exit the train station gate and you wind up somewhere in "
"Kamurocho's underground mall, or in a building, or even the next station!"
