msgstr ""

msgctxt "772_Fatherly Man"
msgid ""
"And even though this invitation came to us through bribery, the man did say "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "784_Fatherly Man"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "796_Shinada"
msgid "Whoa! That much?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "808_Fatherly Man"

msgctxt "844_Michio"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "856_Michio"
msgid ""

msgid ""
"Even a knucklehead like me can understand that. Guess wisdom comes with "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "940_Fatherly Man"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "952_Fatherly Man"

msgctxt "1036_Fatherly Man"

"That I did. In fact, I already made the arrangements to get your boy into "

msgid "So it's a little too late to be changing your mind. A deal's a deal!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1072_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Just turn him down flat. This guy only sees baseball as a way to swindle "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1084_Shinada"

msgctxt "1264_Fatherly Man"

"That was some performance. However, I have to admit I'm still not convinced "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1276_Fatherly Man"
