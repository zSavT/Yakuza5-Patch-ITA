msgctxt "268_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "292_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "328_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "364_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "376_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid "There was a slide right smack dab in the middle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "388_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"Hm? No, that can't be right. The slide is one of the giant dioramas "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "400_Saejima"

msgctxt "412_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "460_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "472_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "484_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "496_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid "Huh? That's not right. The dragon was a smaller statue. I'm sure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "508_Saejima"

msgctxt "556_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "580_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"Ah, that would be Hatsune Miku. Of course someone sculpted her; she's such "

msgctxt "592_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid "I think it was a dragon."

msgctxt "700_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "808_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"I see. I guess the gentleman here gave me wrong info about one of the "

msgctxt "820_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have given you this task."

msgctxt "832_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "844_Saejima"
msgid "No, forget it. Guess I got a bit confused, there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "856_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid "No, no, it's my fault..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "868_Part-time Staffer"
msgid "Should I go take a look at them?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "880_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"No. I don't feel comfortable delegating anymore. If you want a job done "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "892_Saejima"
msgid "Good luck gettin' it done. Lookin' forward to the snow festival."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "904_Snow Festival Staffer"

msgctxt "1012_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1024_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"Oh! Um, I'm the snow festival operations manager. My staff pulled a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1036_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid "I just learned that no one ordered site maps for the visitors."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1048_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"If we don't order them right now, the printers won't have enough time, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1060_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1072_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"I'd love to, but my memory is foggy when it comes to which snow statues are "
"at which locations."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1084_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"And I can't leave my post to go check, and my staff is too busy doing a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1096_Saejima"
msgid "I get it. You're undermanned."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1108_Snow Festival Staffer"

"Exactly! You understand. Hey, wait a minute... Maybe you have some spare "
"time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1120_Saejima"
msgid "Hm?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1132_Snow Festival Staffer"
msgid ""
"I hate to impose, but... would you be willing to check the snow statue "

msgctxt "1180_Snow Festival Staffer"
