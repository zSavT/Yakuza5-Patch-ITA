"Each dish you eat contains all sorts of ingredients－each one with its own "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"So I want you to give some thought to the ingredients being used in the "
"food you eat even before you take your first bite."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"Then you'll see how cooking is the sum of many parts. Eating is more fun "

msgctxt "956_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"Last time, I told you to think about different combinations of ingredients, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"It's a chef's skill that really allows good ingredients to shine through, "
"but there's more to good cooking than that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"You can't just pile tasty food onto a plate. There should be a story behind "
"it, or you should try to convey an emotion through it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"For example, people like to hear how you came up with a certain dish. Or "
"you can try to create something that makes people smile."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"You see, when people know there's more to a dish than its ingredients, "
"they'll appreciate it that much more."

msgid ""
"And that about sums it up. I want you to use all the advice I've given you "

msgid ""
"The chef's stories and emotions? I like it! I'll keep that in mind the next "

msgid ""
"Since you've introduced me to so many great places, I'll give you the best "

msgctxt "1088_Tatsuya"
msgid "You know how people say they're full but still have room for dessert?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"That's because the body is quite an amazing machine. When there's something "
"you really want to eat, it makes a little room for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"You can say the opposite as well. The body feels full and satisfied for "
"quite some time after eating a delicious meal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"Eating is a simple, yet joyful experience. When people think about the food "
"and the person who made it, a meal seems more satisfying."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"And when that feeling of satisfaction lasts even longer, eating becomes an "
"even more pleasurable experience."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"I want you to use all the advice I've given you to make your dining "
"experiences more fun!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"And that about sums it up. I want you to use all the advice I've given you "
"to make your dining experiences more fun!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1196_Shinada"
msgid ""
"So I won't be hungry all the time if I enjoy food more? No, it can't be "
"that simple. But... let me think about it some more."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1220_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"That's about all the advice I can offer. The rest is up to you. Just try "
"different things."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1232_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"Food is a very personal thing, after all, so there's a limit to how much "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1244_Tatsuya"
