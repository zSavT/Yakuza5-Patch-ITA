msgctxt "1304_Shinada"

"Okey-doke. So, I should talk about what a great guy you are while "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1316_Shachoko Manager"
msgid "You don't have to put it so bluntly, but yeah, that's the gist of it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1328_Shinada"
msgid "So what is your platform, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1340_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"Well, I'm an advocate of three key policies: tax cuts, job creation, and "
"childcare support. You could say they're the three pillars of my political "
"philosophy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1352_Shinada"
msgid "Got it. Have you thought of how you're going to achieve all that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1364_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"Of course I have. I'm not just doing this political thing on a whim. It's a "
"bit lengthy, but let me fill you in on these policies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1376_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"First, tax cuts. My primary focus is to reduce the residence tax. We'll "
"make up for the deficit with transfers from the national treasury."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1388_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"By cutting wasteful government spending, we can systematically reduce the "
"tax burden on all of our citizens."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1400_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"That will spur consumer spending in their local communities,\r\n"
"which in turn will stimulate growth nationwide."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1412_Shinada"
msgid "Wow. That sounds like an actual policy!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1424_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"Next, job creation. This also involves tax cuts. By reducing corporate "
"taxes in Nagoya, we'll attract more businesses to the area."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1436_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"But the more money you make, the more taxes you pay. As a result, companies "
"try to move their operations to tax havens offshore."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1448_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"However, if all the rich were to flee Japan, the burden would fall on the "
"rest of us. And eventually it would come full circle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1460_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"That's why I strongly believe reducing the tax burden on companies and the "
"wealthy will revitalize Nagoya's economy and result in new jobs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1472_Shinada"
msgid "Okay, got it. So it's not always bad to give the rich a break. Go figure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1484_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"Third is childcare support. In order to raise the birthrate to sustainable "
"levels, the government needs to do its part to help child-rearing families."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1496_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"I'm proposing that the child tax benefit be increased, with the difference "
"to come from higher taxes for single people."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1508_Shinada"
msgid "Huh? That doesn't sound good for me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1520_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"No, it doesn't. So singles will think it's more worthwhile to raise kids. "
"That will encourage more couples to marry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1532_Shachoko Manager"
msgid ""
"Perhaps this may be criticized as just vote-buying, but I think the "
"government needs to invest in the younger generation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1544_Shinada"
msgid "True, true... Okay, I think I got it all down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1556_Shinada"
msgid "I'll try to work all that into my speech somehow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1568_Shachoko Manager"
msgid "Then I'll be counting on you, Ta-chan!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1580_Shinada"
msgid "Yup. So, just to recap..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1592_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Your three pillars were tax cuts, job creation, and childcare support. Huh, "
"that about does it. Well, here goes nothing!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1676_Shinada"
msgid "You're barking up the wrong tree. Sorry, but no can do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1688_Shachoko Manager"

msgstr ""
