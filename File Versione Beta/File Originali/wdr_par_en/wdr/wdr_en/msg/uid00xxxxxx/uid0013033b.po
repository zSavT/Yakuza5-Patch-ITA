msgctxt "584_Tatsuya"

"Each dish you eat contains all sorts of ingredients－each one with its own "

msgctxt "596_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"So I want you to give some thought to the ingredients being used in the "

msgctxt "608_Tatsuya"

"Then you'll see how cooking is the sum of many parts. Eating is more fun "

"It's a chef's skill that really allows good ingredients to shine through, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"You can't just pile tasty food onto a plate. There should be a story behind "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"For example, people like to hear how you came up with a certain dish. Or "

msgctxt "848_Tatsuya"
msgid "You know how people say they're full but still have room for dessert?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Tatsuya"

"That's because the body is quite an amazing machine. When there's something "
"you really want to eat, it makes a little room for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "872_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"You can say the opposite as well. The body feels full and satisfied for "
"quite some time after eating a delicious meal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "884_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"Eating is a simple, yet joyful experience. When people think about the food "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Tatsuya"
msgid ""
"And when that feeling of satisfaction lasts even longer, eating becomes an "
