msgstr ""

msgctxt "380_Oshima"

msgctxt "560_Oshima"

msgctxt "596_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Oshima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Saejima"
msgid "On parole?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Oshima"
msgid ""
"Mhm. I'm not sure why he's so eager, either. It's not like anyone's ever "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Oshima"
msgid "I asked him why once, and he broke down in tears."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Saejima"
msgid "Really? Baba cried?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Oshima"
msgid ""
"Well. That's when I learned he killed a man for his family, and then his "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Saejima"
msgid "He's in for murder!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Oshima"
msgid ""
"I know. I was shocked, too. He seems so timid. Must've been scared shitless "
"when he did it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Oshima"
msgid ""
"And then his family ditched him. I suppose that's normal in the yakuza "
"world, but still."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Saejima"
msgid "Murder... So he must've served a lot of time before he even got here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Oshima"
msgid "Oh yeah. He's been in prison for ten years. Did the kill when he was twenty."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Oshima"
msgid ""
"Now he's going to re-enter society after being gone a decade. And with no "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Saejima"
msgid "(Poor kid.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Oshima"
msgid ""
"He's gonna have to deal with all that soon. Just a few more days before his "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Saejima"
msgid "Hm... I had no idea."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Oshima"
msgid "Yeah. Look, you're from the same dark underbelly of society as he is, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Oshima"
msgid "So talk to him, will ya? We're cellmates, after all."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Saejima"
msgid "Sure."
