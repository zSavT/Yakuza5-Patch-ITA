msgid ""
"Good, let's get to it. What were we going to do? Improve your dynamic "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "964_Shinada"
msgid "Yes. Something about getting nutrition and building a foundation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "976_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"That's right. By getting the nutrition one needs, the benefits of training "

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1000_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1132_Coach Igarashi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1156_Coach Igarashi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1192_Shinada"

msgid "Of course. Did you think you could just snag a goby and be done with it?"

"A marlin is the pinnacle of piscine power and endurance. It will take your "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1240_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1252_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, Shinada. Did you go eat some chicken dishes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1264_Shinada"
msgid "Sure did. I ate chicken at at least three restaurants, just like you said."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1276_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Good. Your dynamic visual acuity should be better. You'll be able to see "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1288_Shinada"
msgid "I sure hope so. Gotta test it out next time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1300_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Oh, and if I want to keep improving my vision, I should keep eating more "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1312_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "No, I'm afraid it doesn't work that way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1324_Shinada"
msgid "...Knew it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1336_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Consider this akin to laying down the foundation of a building. The "
"nutrients found in chicken are the basis for further growth in your "
"abilities."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1348_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Next time, I'll teach you that training method."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1360_Shinada"
msgid "Cool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1396_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Today, chicken's on the menu. Eat it at three different places in Kineicho, "
"minimum. And three things at the same restaurant won't count. That'd just "
"be dishonest."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1408_Shinada"
msgid "I'm here, Coach! Train me up right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1420_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Oh, you're back again. All right, let's not waste any time. I'll have you "
"hone your dynamic visual acuity even further."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1432_Shinada"
msgid "Oh, like the time you made me eat anthocyanins? What should I do this time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1444_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Hit the town and go scarf down some chicken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1456_Shinada"
msgid "Chicken? So I should be eating more protein now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1468_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"That's right. Chicken is ideal for its ample amount of animal protein. "
"Plus, Nagoya's famous for the stuff."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1480_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You get to eat well, and you gain the benefits of training. Isn't that a "
"win-win situation?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1492_Shinada"
msgid "It would be... if I didn't have to pay for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1504_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Did I mention you have to try at least three different restaurants? You "
"can't just go to one place and expect to learn everything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1516_Shinada"
msgid "Aww, why not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1528_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Every restaurant prepares and flavors their food differently. Nutritional "
"intake varies with the cooking method, temperature, added ingredients, and "
"so on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1540_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"This training also makes you locate good restaurants. That alone should "
"improve your attention and mental strength."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1552_Shinada"
msgid ""
"You really think so? Well, I'm not one to argue.  Then I'm off to find the "
"tastiest chicken in town!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1564_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "You do that. Get some good nutrition into you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1576_Shinada"
msgid "I'm back, Coach."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1588_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, yes. Well? Did you manage to eat food with anthocyanins?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1600_Shinada"
msgid "I did. It certainly was a challenge, but I managed somehow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1612_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Good. That should have improved your dynamic visual acuity."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1624_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Remember your ability to focus and see pitches as if they were suspended in "
"time? That ability should be more pronounced now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1636_Shinada"
msgid "Oh, that thing. Yeah, I'll definitely give that a try."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1648_Shinada"
msgid ""
"I'll go eat some more anthocyanins, too. That's gonna keep improving my "
"vision, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1660_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "I highly doubt that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1672_Shinada"
msgid "...Why?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1684_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Training isn't that simple. This time, your dynamic visual acuity was "
"improved using a certain form of nutrition, but don't expect that to happen "
"every time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1696_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Anyhow. If you want to enhance this ability further, come see me again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1708_Shinada"
msgid "Cool."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1744_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Go out and find food that contains anthocyanins. There should be plenty in "
"town.  Simple enough for you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1756_Shinada"
msgid "Hey, Coach. What you got for me today?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1768_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, Shinada. Here to train? Then I'd be glad to help you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1780_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Let's see now... How about working on your dynamic visual acuity?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1792_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Oh, was that the one where you made me go fishing? Okay, I'll go grab some "
"worms off the ground and－"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1804_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Don't get ahead of yourself. It's not fishing this time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1816_Shinada"
msgid "...Then what is it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1828_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "You should like this. We're taking a nutritional approach this time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1840_Shinada"
msgid "Nutritional? As in, I should eat something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1852_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"That's right. By giving your body the nutrition it needs, the benefits of "
"training become more pronounced."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1864_Shinada"
msgid ""
"I can dig it. Hey, isn't there some nutrient that's good for the eyes or "
"whatever?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1876_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Indeed there is. It's called anthocyanin. Now go eat something that "
"contains it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1888_Shinada"
msgid "That's it? Psh, that doesn't sound too hard."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1900_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Of course not. All you're doing is eating. There's no challenge whatsoever, "
"unless you've stuffed yourself beforehand or something."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1912_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Heheh, this one's in the bag. So what kind of food contains\r\n"
"anthocyanins?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1924_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "No idea."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1936_Shinada"
msgid "...Come again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1948_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"I said I have no idea. You go find it yourself, whatever has anthocyanins "
"in it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1960_Shinada"
msgid "Coach, have I ever told you you're a hardass?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1972_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Shut your whine-hole and get on with it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1984_Shinada"
msgid "Dammit. Fine, I'll get out there..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1996_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, you're back. Did you get your prize?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2008_Shinada"
msgid "Yup. Got the dragon, as instructed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2020_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Good job. So, how was it? Do you feel like you can foul off pitches better?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2032_Shinada"
msgid ""
"I haven't noticed that yet, no. But, I do feel like I've gotten into the "
"habit of seeing better in three-dimensional space."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2044_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Yes, I would hope so. In a real game situation, you should notice that your "
"foul hitting timing will be longer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2056_Shinada"
msgid "No kidding? Dang, I'll definitely have to try that out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2092_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Get yourself a dragon from a UFO Catcher. I know that's a crazy sentence to "

"Now hop to it!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2104_Shinada"
msgid "Back again, Coach."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2116_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Hey, Shinada. What shall we have you work on today..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2128_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, yes, how about training that will let you hit more fouls?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2140_Shinada"
msgid "Fouls? Uh, I'd rather work on home runs, if it's all the same to you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2152_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Now, now. You do understand how important it is to foul off tough pitches, "
"right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2164_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"It's an established tactic to wear out pitchers by making them throw extra. "
"You can also foul off pitches until you get the one you want."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2176_Shinada"
msgid "Yeah, I get that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2188_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Then quit your bellyaching and work on your timing. You need those fouls to "
"win, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2200_Shinada"
msgid "Okay, you convinced me. So what do you want me to do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2212_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You've tried those UFO Catcher machines, haven't you? I believe there's a "
"Club SEGA here in town."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2224_Shinada"
msgid "I know all about those, but really? A claw machine?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2236_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Yes, really. Go play a UFO Catcher and bring me back a dragon figure. I'm "
"sure you'll get it eventually."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2248_Shinada"
msgid "Uh... not sure I get the connection. How's that supposed to help my batting?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2260_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Ha, your shallow thinking betrays you again. Listen. The keys to winning "
"prizes from a UFO Catcher are sublime control and perception."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2272_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"One must take aim on a three-dimensional axis, precisely control the arm, "
"and accurately lower it upon its target."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2284_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"The process, from start to finish, is identical to batting. The batter "
"determines the ball's position along three axes, and strikes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2296_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"To get a proper hit, you can make do with sheer power. But deliberately "
"fouling takes more than that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2308_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You need the same precise control and depth perception as you would for "
"getting a prize from a UFO Catcher."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2320_Shinada"
msgid "Hmm... I think I'm beginning to see it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2332_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Good, then you have nothing to moan about. Now go on and get me that dragon."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2344_Shinada"
msgid "Got it, Coach. I'll be off, then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2356_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "You're back, Shinada. It looks like you scored over 800 points at karaoke."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2368_Shinada"
msgid "Yeah, somehow. Thought I might lose my voice in the process!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2380_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Well? Did you get the sense that your impact timing has improved?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2392_Shinada"
msgid ""
"It's hard to say, but my senses do feel sharper. I wouldn't know until I "
"try, though."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2404_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Oh, I'm sure you've gained something. Your impact window should feel longer "
"in actual game situations and at batting centers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2416_Shinada"
msgid "That would sure be nice. I'll have to try that out."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2452_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Go to Karaokekan in Kineicho and score at least 800 points. Get moving."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2464_Shinada"
msgid "Howdy, Coach. Ready to start the day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2476_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, Shinada. Back for more toil and punishment?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2488_Shinada"
msgid "Yes, sir. You know I love to train."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2500_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Heh, that's a laugh. I don't seem to remember you being very diligent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2512_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Forget it, though. Today, you'll be working on your impact timing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2524_Shinada"
msgid "That's a good idea. I could always use a wider impact window, so to speak."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2536_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Indeed. Widening your impact window will help you make solid contact with "
"the ball, even when your swing is a little off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2548_Shinada"
msgid "Then what's the first thing I should do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2560_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Go sing some karaoke. You can do that somewhere in Kineicho, can't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2572_Shinada"
msgid "Um. What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2584_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "You heard me. Karaoke. You know what that is, don't you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2596_Shinada"
msgid "Well yeah, who doesn't? But can this really be considered training?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2608_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Absolutely. Singing is an effective form of exercise. Do you know how much "
"energy you spend singing a song?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2620_Shinada"
msgid "Couldn't tell you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2632_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"It depends on the song, but around 10 kilocalories. For those three "
"minutes, singing uses about as much energy as walking down the block."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2644_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"And if you give it all you got, your lungs get a solid workout. That's why "
"I recommend singing as part of physical training."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2656_Shinada"
msgid "I guess that makes sense."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2668_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"But that's not all. Karaoke makes you keep time by using your sight, "
"hearing, and sense of rhythm."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2680_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "These elements are pretty important for batting, don't you think?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2692_Shinada"

msgctxt "2704_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Okay. So here's your assignment. Score at least 800 points at karaoke."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2716_Shinada"
msgid "That's asking quite a lot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2728_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Indeed. It takes a rigorous mentality to hone impact timing,\r\n"
"especially to the point where you can really see results."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2740_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Now get going."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2752_Shinada"
msgid "Yes, sir."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2764_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, Shinada. So you've won that game of pool, have you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2776_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Yup. It wasn't easy, but I kept a close eye on the dynamics of the balls in "
"play, like you said."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2788_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Well done. This training was designed to help you read the pitcher's "
"motions when you go up to bat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2800_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You should be better at predicting what kind of pitch is coming, as well as "
"the course it takes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2812_Shinada"
msgid "Yeah, I feel like you might be right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2824_Shinada"
msgid "Thanks, Coach. I'll check it out as soon as I get the chance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2860_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Go play pool and beat an intermediate opponent at nine-ball."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2872_Shinada"
msgid "It's training time, Coach. Let's do this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2884_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, Shinada. Let's see. How about we hone your ability to read pitches?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2896_Shinada"
msgid "Okay, but I should let you know－my vision's pretty darn good already."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2908_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"It's not a matter of having good eyesight. For a batter, there are other "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2920_Shinada"
msgid "True..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2932_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"This time, I want you to play pool. There just so happens to be a table "
"right here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2944_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Will that really help me read pitches? I mean, that's a\r\n"
"completely different game."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2956_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Do you know the rules of pool?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2968_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Well, sure. You poke a ball with a cue, and try to knock another ball in a "
"pocket."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2980_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Essentially, yes. But you also need to instantly calculate the angle for "
"striking the cue ball, as well as its trajectory. Not to mention ricochet "
"and rotation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2992_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"And it's pointless to just hit the balls willy-nilly. Each play demands an "
"incredible amount of calculation, taxing your brain and your nerves to the "
"limit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3004_Shinada"
msgid "Huh... Never realized there was that much going on at the pool table."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3016_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Well, if you apply all that to baseball, you'll see that it'll help your "
"ability to read pitches."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3028_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Based on the pitcher's grip, release, and subtle differences in form, you "
"should be able to have a better grasp on where their pitch will go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3040_Shinada"
msgid "You know... I think you're onto something."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3052_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You just now realized that? Anyway, go beat an intermediate opponent at "
"nine-ball."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3064_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "That should dramatically improve your ability to focus on pitches."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3076_Shinada"
msgid "I'm all over it, Coach. Time to crush the competition!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3088_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "So, you got yourself three home runs on intermediate. Well done."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3100_Shinada"
msgid "'Course I did. Simple as a pimple, for me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3112_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"From now on, you should have an easier time aiming for\r\n"
"those pitches you know'll make a big impact."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3124_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"When you go to swing, catching the pitch squarely with your bat's sweet "
"spot will let you hit hard and far."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3136_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Mm. Yeah. I'm feeling that. Like, I can already see myself\r\n"
"knocking it into the grandstands... that is, if I were in a\r\n"
"stadium."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3148_Shinada"
msgid "Anyway, I'll test it out later, Coach. Thanks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3184_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Oh, by the way. I was online and came across a website I\r\n"
"thought you might find interesting. Here, you should check\r\n"
"it out sometime."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3208_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Hit home runs using only one type of swing. I expect you can hit three on "
"the intermediate course. And be consistent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3220_Shinada"
msgid "I'm ready, Coach! Train me up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3232_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Shinada, I like your enthusiasm."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3244_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Let's see, how about you try something that will enhance your trademark "
"power-hitting?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3256_Shinada"
msgid "That works, but don't you think I'm good as-is?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3268_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Perhaps, but strength alone won't bring you better batting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3280_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Even if you have the raw power, if you lack the discipline to control it, "
"then it's virtually a waste."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3292_Shinada"
msgid "Well, that is true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3304_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "So, your next assignment. Go to Kineicho Batting Center again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3316_Shinada"
msgid "Didn't we do that last time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3328_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"It'll be a little different. First, you'll be moving up to the intermediate "
"course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3340_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "And second, you're only going to use a specific swing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3352_Shinada"
msgid "You mean, only swing high or low? Something like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3364_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Exactly. Just be sure to be consistent with the direction you choose. Now "
"let's see... Go hit three home runs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3376_Shinada"
msgid "Isn't that asking a bit much?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3388_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "For an ordinary person, yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3400_Shinada"
msgid "Right? So, how about making it a bit more reasonable?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3412_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Why would I? You're supposed to be this legendary phenomenon who's "
"overflowing with talent."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3424_Shinada"
msgid "Bah."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3436_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "You'll be fine. Now quit whining and get going!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3448_Shinada"
msgid "All right, but I'm still not convinced."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3460_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"The convincing might just happen when you step up to the plate. You never "
"know until you try."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3472_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Ah, you've completed your training. I see confidence in that expression of "
"yours."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3484_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Do you? Hmm, I guess I do feel like I have a bigger sweet spot now, no "
"matter what angle I'm going for."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3496_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "It's not just your imagination. See for yourself at the batting center."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3508_Shinada"
msgid "Will do, Coach."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3544_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Try hitting three home runs on the Beginner Course, with random pitches "
"selected. That should broaden your range of sweet spots."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3556_Shinada"
msgid "Hey, Coach. It's training time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3568_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Ah, Shinada. So it's training you want, huh? You ready to be\r\n"
"pushed to the limit?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3580_Shinada"
msgid "Yep, that's why I came to see you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3592_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Very well. You got the right attitude."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3604_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Watching you bat, I noticed something. You have a pretty narrow range for "
"hitting pitches."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3616_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Maybe you're right. There's usually this little zone where I imagine I can "
"hit the ball. And it's generally quite small."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3628_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Thought so. If you don't expand the range of your sweet spots, you'll have "
"a rough time against, say, pitchers who throw breaking balls."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3640_Shinada"
msgid "For real... Those guys always throw me for a loop."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3652_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"If you can't cover more of the strike zone, you'll get gunned down even by "
"beer league amateurs, let alone that rival of yours."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3664_Shinada"
msgid "Tell me about it. So, how can I train for that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3676_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Try this. Go to the batting center. The one here in Nagoya, of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3688_Shinada"
msgid "The batting center? Isn't that a bit... I dunno... obvious?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3700_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"It better be. Now look, I know what I'm talking about. Try out the Beginner "
"Course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3712_Shinada"
msgid "Really? That only goes like a hundred kilometers an hour."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3724_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"What, you got a problem with that? How fast do you think beer leaguers "
"pitch?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3736_Shinada"
msgid "Around one hundred kilometers an hour..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3748_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "See? What's the problem then?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3760_Shinada"
msgid "...Point taken."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3772_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"So. Try hitting three homers on the Beginner Course, with random pitches "
"selected. That should broaden your range of sweet spots."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3784_Shinada"
msgid "You got it, Coach."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3796_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "I see you've gone and fished something up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3808_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Well? Does it feel like anything's changed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3820_Shinada"
msgid ""
"I think I can see with a bit more clarity than before.\r\n"
"Is that what you're getting at?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3832_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You betcha. Go up to bat right now, and you should notice a curious new "
"ability has awakened within. One like you've never felt before."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3844_Shinada"
msgid "Oh wow..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3856_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Yeah, let's go see it right now. To the batting center we go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3868_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You haven't completed your assignment. Go fishing in the stream at Mid "
"Square."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3880_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Just catch something－doesn't matter what. Got it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3892_Shinada"
msgid "All right, Coach. Hit me with the hardest training you got!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3904_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "I should tell you, Shinada. There's nothing left for me to teach you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3916_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You've grown admirably since you first walked up to me\r\n"
"with those eyes that said, \"Teach me how to put my soul\r\n"
"back into batting.\" At least that's how I interpreted it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3928_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Don't leave those past issues hanging, now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3940_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Well, look who it is. Looking to get trained up?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3952_Player"
msgid "Nope, I'm good for now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3964_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Mm. Well, all right. Come see me if you do need training, though. I'll be "
"here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3976_Player"
msgid "You bet. Train me up, Coach."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "3988_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, there's nothing I can teach you "
"right now. Come see me if you find yourself struggling with something in "
"particular."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4024_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, you're back. Well? Kamiyama whip you up some top-tier gear?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4036_Shinada"
msgid "Eventually. Sure was a tough slog getting there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4048_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Well, the man makes good stuff. Stuff you can depend on. Make sure you "
"treat it well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4060_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Of course. I remember you were always super strict about how we handled our "
"equipment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4072_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Damn straight. How can you expect good results if you don't\r\n"
"take care of your things? It's like a worker and his tools."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4084_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Very true. The pros were pretty fussy about their equipment, too－at least "
"the ones who were any good."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4096_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Anyone with any kind of sense knows the difference between quality "
"equipment versus weather-beaten crap. I suggest you make an effort to "
"upgrade your arsenal every now and then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4108_Shinada"
msgid "Will do, sir."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4120_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Speaking of beefing up your inventory, I found a good shop\r\n"
"online. Here, why don't you take down the address?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4156_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Get this Kamiyama guy to make you some custom baseball equipment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4168_Shinada"
msgid "Howdy, Coach. I'm back again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4180_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Ah, yes. I've been waiting for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4192_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Now, I have to ask, what kind of batting equipment are you using these days?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4204_Shinada"
msgid "As in, like, bats and gloves? Mm, the stuff I use is all store-bought."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4216_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Mhm. I thought I wouldn't need to say this, but you really should be using "
"better gear."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4228_Shinada"
msgid "But all I have access to is stuff off the shelves. Is that really so bad?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4240_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"You of all people should know the value of high-grade equipment, especially "
"since you actually used to use it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4252_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Yeah, but that was ages ago. My days of having fun with\r\n"
"league-worthy equipment are long gone, unfortunately."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4264_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "Huh. Well. You have any friends who are craftsmen?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4288_Shinada"
msgid ""
"You mean, like, someone who could make me equipment on their own? Nope, "
"don't have a clue."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4300_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "I know one man－his name's Kamiyama. Operates out of a van somewhere in town."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4312_Shinada"
msgid "Yeah? Don't you think that seems... kinda shady?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4324_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"That it does. I'm unfamiliar with the details myself. So your assignment is "
"to get him to make you some baseball equipment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4336_Shinada"
msgid "That's it? Can't I at least get some more clues?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4348_Coach Igarashi"
msgid "You could, if I had any. Sounds like you've got a challenge on your hands."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4360_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"That said, maybe that's part of my intention. <Italic>Maybe</Italic> I "

msgctxt "4372_Shinada"
msgid "But..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4384_Shinada"
msgid "But that's not fair!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4396_Coach Igarashi"
msgid ""
"Hahaha. Don't you live here? I'm sure there are plenty of ways you can "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4408_Shinada"
msgid "Okay... I'll go look."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "4420_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4432_Coach Igarashi"
