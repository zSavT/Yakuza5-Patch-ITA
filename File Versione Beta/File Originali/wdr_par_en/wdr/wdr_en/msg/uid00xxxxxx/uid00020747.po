msgctxt "132_Old-timer Inmate"

msgctxt "144_Saejima"

"The chisels all got numbers, and they're assigned to certain woodworkers, "

msgctxt "480_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid "So it is."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "492_Saejima"
msgid "Well? Any news?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "504_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"Sure. You wish to know about inmates with access to chisels, yes? That "
"would be the woodworking and leathercraft crews. Them, and only them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "516_Saejima"
msgid "Leathercraft?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "528_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"Yeah. They make goods like wallets and purses, then sell them to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "540_Saejima"
msgid "Okay, just those two crews. Ya sure?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "552_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid "Haha. Doubt me if you want. But I know a lot more..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "564_Saejima"
msgid "Yeah?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"For instance, it's been a long time since any orders for leather came in. "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "588_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"In fact, the last two years, there's been no leathercrafting at all. You'll "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Saejima"
msgid "...Wow."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"Anyway, that means the only convicts with chisel access are the "
"woodworkers. That's a fact."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid "Another fact: every chisel is marked with a unique number."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "636_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid "Inmates can only use the chisel that's assigned to them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "648_Saejima"
msgid ""
"Makes sense. Woulda been pretty dumb if the guards weren't keepin' track of "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "660_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid "One last fact－you'll like this one. One of the woodworkers is... Kugihara."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "672_Saejima"

msgctxt "756_Saejima"
msgid "Didn't figure you to be the info man."

msgctxt "768_Old-timer Inmate"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Saejima"
msgid "Guess I shouldn't be surprised you know my name."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"Please. I'm the info man. Of course, a celebrity like you, everyone inside "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"So. You want to know things that'll help you clear Shigeki Baba of assault. "

msgctxt "816_Saejima"
msgid ""
"I can see ya already know a lot about it. Well then, let's skip ahead to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"Haha, you make it sound easy. But they're being tight-lipped and even "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Saejima"
msgid "Are ya gonna tell me, or not?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid "You'll have to pony up a fair payment. So listen good."

msgctxt "864_Old-timer Inmate"

msgctxt "876_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"I need you to get some goods from him. Don't ask what they are, that's none "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"Take the goods to the guard standing in front of and to the left of you. "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid ""
"Don't just walk up to him. Pass it through the fence. Don't worry, it's "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "924_Old-timer Inmate"
msgid "I got lots of friends here, like those two. But I got even more enemies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Old-timer Inmate"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Saejima"
