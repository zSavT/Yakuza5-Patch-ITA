msgctxt "208_Saejima"

msgctxt "220_Attendant"

"It's over on Lavender Street. The interior is a little on the dark side, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "232_Attendant"

msgctxt "508_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Since your time in the club is limited, do your best to make yourself as "
"appealing as you can to the hostess in question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "520_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If all you do is make her talk, she's likely to get bored of you quite "
"quickly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "532_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You'd be better off visiting various establishments around town, to pick up "
"on local gossip. That way you'll have plenty of things to talk about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "544_Player"
msgid "Makes sense. Guys who get out more got a lot more stuff to talk about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "556_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Indeed. And if talking isn't doing the trick, you could always try spending "
"more money."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "568_Player"
msgid "Ya mean like orderin' more pricey drinks?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "580_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Precisely. You could also give the lady presents to increase her favor. Oh, "
"and putting in a little extra effort into how you dress never hurts either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "592_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you're willing to spend the money, you're likely to get a return on your "
"investment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "604_Player"
msgid "No one likes a cheapskate, huh."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "616_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Not usually, no. It is important to be able to get a hostess the very best "
"drink you can."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "628_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Spending big amounts of cash can win a girl over in a surprisingly short "
"period of time, so if you're in a hurry, try saving up some money."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "640_Player"
msgid "So if you're good at talkin', ya don't need to spend as much money. That it?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "652_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Correct. If you don't want to spend a great deal of money, it is advisable "
"to find other ways to get the lady to like you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "664_Player"
msgid "Yeah, I hear ya."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "676_Attendant"
msgid "Oh, right! There's one more important thing I forgot to mention."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "688_Attendant"
msgid "If things are going really well, it can be a good idea to take your leave."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "700_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you keep prattling on after that, you risk killing the mood and undoing "
"all the hard work you did."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "712_Player"
msgid "S'pose that's true."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "724_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Lastly, before you leave, be sure to ask her if she'd like to go out with "
"you on a date later."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "736_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Taking a hostess on a date can further increase her fondness for you, "
"especially if you are able to work the right magic."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "748_Player"
msgid "Alright. You've been a lotta help. Thanks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "760_Attendant"
msgid "Did you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "772_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You can invite hostesses out to join you on dates. During these you can "
"grab a bite to eat, go shopping, or play games together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "784_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Taking them out on dates will increase their affection towards you, so "
"you've got nothing to lose by asking them out when you visit the club."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "796_Player"
msgid "But askin' a girl out doesn't mean she's always gonna say yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "808_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Correct. Whether she takes you up on your offer or not depends largely on "
"her mood."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "820_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If you're not good enough friends with her, she'll most likely reject your "
"proposal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "832_Attendant"
msgid ""
"If that's the case, then try to improve her mood. It's important for her to "
"have a good time as well."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "844_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Also, if you show up at the club and ask her out right away, you're "
"probably not going to get a very positive response either."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "856_Player"
msgid "So it's all about timin'."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "868_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Oh, yes. But if she turns you down, don't give up. If you keep on asking, "
"she may eventually give in and say yes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "880_Player"
msgid "Okay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "892_Attendant"
msgid "Did you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "904_Attendant"
msgid "Oh, I wouldn't possibly know anything about that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "916_Player"
msgid "Hm..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "928_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Okay, wait, I have something! Once you've talked your hostess up as much as "
"you can, you normally wouldn't need to order anything else for the "
"remainder of your time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "940_Attendant"
msgid ""
"However, if you order something anyway, she might treat you to a... "
"different sort of hospitality."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "952_Player"
msgid "Whaddya mean by \"a different sorta hospitality\"?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "964_Attendant"
msgid ""
"You knooow, things like hand-feeding you pieces of fruit, maybe some fun "
"and naughty things with candies or desserts..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "976_Player"
msgid "That sorta does sound appealin'."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "988_Attendant"
msgid ""
"Indeed, it is the pinnacle of excess. One of the finer thrills that money "
"well spent can buy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1000_Attendant"
msgid "Did you have any other questions?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1012_Attendant"
msgid "Ah! How did things work out for you last time, sir?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1024_Saejima"
msgid "Very well. Ya really know yer clubs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1036_Attendant"
