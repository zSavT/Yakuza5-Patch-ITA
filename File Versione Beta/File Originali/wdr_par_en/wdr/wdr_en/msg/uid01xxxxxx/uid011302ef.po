msgstr ""

msgctxt "3740_Saejima"

"That is just the way of the world, Saejima. Some things simply cannot be "

"I also noticed the offerings I need to get are startin' to get more "

msgctxt "3872_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "3884_Tendo"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4700_Saejima"
msgid ""
"Look, if you don't wanna talk about it, fine. But you gotta stop tryin' to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "4712_Saejima"

msgctxt "4736_Tendo"
