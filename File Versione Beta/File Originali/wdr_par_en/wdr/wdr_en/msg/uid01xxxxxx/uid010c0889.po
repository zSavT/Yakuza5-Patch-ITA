msgctxt "444_Wada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "456_Kiryu"

"You're sharp. The top three racers in Fukuoka at the time took on that name "

msgctxt "480_Wada"

msgctxt "540_Wada"

msgctxt "552_Wada"

msgctxt "576_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Kiryu"
msgid "That is true..."
msgstr ""

"You should use this time to get some practice. You need to train if you "

msgctxt "648_Kiryu"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Wada"
