msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Haruka"
msgid "Sorry?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"I wanna get your definition. When ya think of a middle-aged man, 'bout how "

msgctxt "668_Haruka"
msgid "I'm sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Haruka"
msgid "I would say anywhere between 25 and 60 is middle aged."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"That so? Seems kinda young to me. You really think a 25-year-old guy is "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Well, I don't know if \"middle aged\" is the best term for it. I just mean, "

msgctxt "716_Mizuguchi"

"That's a nice answer. With a positive comment about older men like that, "

msgctxt "728_Mizuguchi"
msgid "Hey, I bet you'll even earn yourself some new fans."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Haruka"
msgid "I would say anywhere between 35 and 50 is middle aged."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Mizuguchi"
msgid "Oh, yeah? So ya think a guy in his early 30s is still young, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Haruka"
msgid "Yes, I do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"Well! With a liberal view like that on men's ages, I think this interview "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Haruka"
msgid "I would say any man over 20 is no longer a young man."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"Ouch! That's pretty harsh. In that case, you're talkin' about guys still in "

msgctxt "812_Haruka"
msgid "Yes, I guess so."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Mizuguchi"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Okay. Next question. Let's imagine for a minute that you're over eighteen, "
"and there's an older man ya like."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Mizuguchi"
msgid "So he asks ya out on a late-night date. Where'd you like to go?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Haruka"
msgid "Late at night, you say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "872_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"Yeah, well, older men work during the daytime. Besides, guys might get some "
"dirty looks if they're out with a younger woman during the day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "884_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"And they're adults after all, so of course they wanna go as far as they "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Haruka"
msgid "I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "908_Mizuguchi"
msgid "So, what destination would make ya wanna say yes to a date?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "920_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "932_Mizuguchi"
msgid "What, are ya sayin' you wouldn't say yes?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "944_Haruka"
msgid "I'm sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "956_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"Ouch, that's cold. A lot of our readers will be real disappointed. Ya "
"could've at least given them an ounce of hope."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Haruka"
msgid ""
"A private room in a restaurant. I guess there wouldn't be anything wrong "
"with having a meal together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"A restaurant, huh? Not a bad idea. You're not old enough to drink yet, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Haruka"
msgid "And I love going out to eat."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"That's a pretty good suggestion. A restaurant sounds innocent enough that "
"the guy might be able to hide his true intentions, too."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Mizuguchi"
msgid "Yeah! I like that answer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Haruka"
msgid "I like to sing, so a private karaoke room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Mizuguchi"
msgid "Well! But as a young lady, wouldn't ya be a little worried?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Mizuguchi"
msgid "I mean, it is a private room and all. What if he suddenly makes a move?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064_Haruka"
msgid "Oh, um... I'm not really sure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"'Course, I'd never do anythin' like that. I can tell ya one thing, though. "
"I bet our readers are gonna like that answer of yours!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088_Haruka"
msgid ""
"An observation deck with a beautiful night view. I think most girls like "
"that kind of thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"Oh, okay! Nice! And then he could pull ya in real close, and you could rest "
"your cheek on his shoulder..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Haruka"
msgid "Well, I didn't say all that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Mizuguchi"
msgid "Hehe, whoops! I guess I let my imagination run away there."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Mizuguchi"
msgid "No matter. I think you've given our readers a very good suggestion."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Now for the last question of the interview. If you were over eighteen, do "
"ya think you would ever consider having sex with a middle-aged man?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Haruka"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"Hey, it is the last question and all, so I thought, what the heck? It'd be "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Mizuguchi"
msgid "So, what do ya think? Would you have sex with a middle-aged man?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1208_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1220_Mizuguchi"
msgid ""
"Okay, okay. I know that was an indelicate question, but you gotta gimme "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1232_Haruka"
msgid "I'm sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1244_Mizuguchi"
