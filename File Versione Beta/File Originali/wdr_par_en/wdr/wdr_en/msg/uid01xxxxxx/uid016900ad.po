msgctxt "440_Haruka"

msgctxt "452_Karube"
msgid ""
"That's great. This agency is pretty small, so I was a little worried, to be "

"Well, let's get right to it, shall we? So, what do you think about the "
"Princess League system?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Haruka"
msgid "Um, sorry?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "584_Karube"
msgid ""
"I mean, it must be great for unknown talent like you. You can get your face "
"on TV, even without much proven experience."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "596_Karube"
msgid ""
"Plus, the station can produce a profitable TV show without having to pay "
"its talent very much. A win-win, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Karube"
msgid ""
"But, on the other hand, the level of talent is often hit-or-miss. Don't you "
"think that lowers the overall quality of this type of program?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Karube"
msgid ""
"So taking all that into consideration, is the Princess League system really "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Karube"
msgid ""
"The right to remain silent, huh? Well, that's all right. If I can't get a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Karube"
msgid "I mean, we don't want to bore our readers, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Haruka"
msgid "I think that's a question for the director. I'm just a contestant."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Karube"
msgid ""
"But I came all this way to ask what you think about things. Telling me to "
"ask somebody else won't help me write a good article."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Haruka"
msgid ""
"All I know is that I do my own job to the best of my ability. I can't say "
"anything about the rest of what you asked about."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Karube"
msgid ""
"So, you don't care about the overall quality of the TV programming you "
"benefit from? I see. Maybe the question was too difficult for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Well, the wonderful thing about the Princess League is that it gives girls "
"a chance to compete, and truly try their very hardest at something "
"worthwhile."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Karube"
msgid ""
"Are you saying that you don't care if the viewers have to watch low-quality "
"performances?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Not at all. I don't feel the quality of my own performance is low, and I "
"believe all of the contestants train hard and do their absolute best."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Karube"
msgid ""
"I see. Well, I have to agree. When I saw you perform, I really thought you "
"had something special."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Karube"
msgid ""
"And I could tell that you'd been through some pretty grueling training. I "
"guess if the system produces performers like you, it must have some merit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I think if someone doesn't like a particular TV show, they don't have to "
"watch it. There are lots of other channels."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Karube"
msgid "Ha. That sounds like a cop-out answer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I just mean, all I can do is give the very best performance I can, and try "
"to please the people who do choose to watch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Karube"
msgid ""
"You know, with an attitude like that you'll never become anything more than "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Karube"
msgid "Real stars can outshine any TV show they happen to appear on."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Karube"
msgid "But maybe you just don't have that star quality yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Well, moving on. There's another problem I see with the Princess League "
"system: performances are rated by studio audience voting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Karube"
msgid ""
"That's a pretty vague criterion, don't you think? Can singing and dancing "
"really be evaluated with a numerical score?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "872_Haruka"
msgid "Um..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "884_Karube"
msgid "Was the question was too difficult?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Haruka"
msgid "I'm very sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "908_Karube"
msgid "How am I supposed to write my article if you don't answer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "920_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Audience voting may be a vague criterion, but I do think it gives a useful "
"point of reference. And it might just make us work that much harder!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "932_Karube"
msgid ""
"But couldn't fans just vote for their favorite, and not who actually "
"performed the best? Is it really a meaningful evaluation?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "944_Haruka"
msgid "From what I've seen from the show, it seems pretty accurate to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "956_Karube"
msgid "I see. So you're basing your opinion on your own observations?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Karube"
msgid ""
"To be honest, I actually do think the scores seem to be pretty spot on. "
"From what I've observed, at least."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Haruka"
msgid "Really?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Karube"
msgid ""
"Yes. Somehow, the audience seems to get it right every time. I guess "
"they're a pretty discerning bunch."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I don't really pay much attention to the scores, actually. Like you said, I "
"don't really believe singing and dancing can be given a numerical score."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Karube"
msgid ""
"But in that case, wouldn't it follow that it doesn't matter if you win or "
"lose because it's based on meaningless scores?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Haruka"
msgid "Hm. I guess that makes sense..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Karube"
msgid ""
"Haha. I guess it's a pretty flawed system, if even the contestants "
"themselves don't believe in it. Wow, that'll sure get our reader's "
"attention!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I think the scoring system is fair. Performances vary in quality, and I "
"think the scores reflect that pretty accurately."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Karube"
msgid ""
"A performance can be technically skilled, but that isn't always what "
"appeals to an audience."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088_Karube"
msgid ""
"Sometimes the value of a performance goes beyond technique, wouldn't you "
"agree?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Of course. But the scores are the votes of each audience member, and I "
"think they reflect how much the performer touched their heart individually."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Haruka"
msgid "So I don't believe the Princess League scores are based on technique alone."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Karube"
msgid "You've got a point there. Hm. That's a pretty good answer, actually."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Haruka"
msgid ""
"So that brings us to my last question. Now, to tell you the truth, I used "
"to be a huge fan of a certain idol named Mirei Park."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Haruka"
msgid "Oh? You were Park-san's fan?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Karube"
msgid ""
"That's right. And I know you were her favorite. So, let me ask you this. Do "
"you believe you will surpass her one day?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1196_Karube"
msgid ""
"Hey, how am I supposed to make this into an interview if you won't even "
"answer!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1208_Haruka"
msgid "I'm sorry."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1220_Karube"
msgid ""
"This has been a complete waste of my time. Now I'll have to find some other "
"article to put in place of your interview. Ugh, what a pain!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1232_Haruka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1244_Karube"
msgid "Come on, that was my best question!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1256_Haruka"
msgid "I'm sorry!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1268_Karube"
msgid ""
"Oh, well. I guess it really wasn't fair to ask you to answer a question "
"like that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1280_Haruka"
msgid "I believe I've already surpassed her."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1292_Karube"
msgid ""
"Whoa! That's a bold statement! I didn't expect you to say something like "
"that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1304_Haruka"
msgid ""
"Park-san poured everything she had into me, and that's what makes me work "
"so hard every day."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1316_Karube"
msgid "I see. Well, I certainly admire your spirit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1328_Karube"
msgid "But that is quite a big boast, saying you've already surpassed Mirei Park."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1340_Karube"
msgid "I'll be following your career with an even more critical eye now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1352_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I'm going to try my hardest to surpass her. Park-san is a personal idol of "
"mine."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1364_Karube"
msgid ""
"Good luck to you, then. From what I've seen, I think you just might be able "
"to do it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1376_Haruka"
msgid "Oh! Do you really think so?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1388_Karube"
msgid ""
"Are you surprised? Anyway, thank you for the great comment there at the "
"end. That will really round out the article."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1400_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I don't think she and I can be compared. We each have our own individual "
"paths. It's not about who surpasses whom."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1412_Karube"
msgid ""
"I guess you have a point. But you know, as Park-san's favorite, I'll "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1424_Haruka"
msgid "You will?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1436_Karube"

"Anyways, that concludes our interview. I want to apologize to you. I know I "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1472_Haruka"
msgid "Oh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1484_Karube"

"It's just my interviewing style. I find that being harsh and aggressive "
