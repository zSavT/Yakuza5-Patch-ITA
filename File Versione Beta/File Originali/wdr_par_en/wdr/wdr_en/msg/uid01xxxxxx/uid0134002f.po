msgctxt "1280_Shinada"

"How much money are we talking? If a girl like you considers herself not "

msgctxt "1472_Shinada"

msgctxt "1520_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1532_Shion"

msgctxt "1556_Shinada"

msgctxt "1568_Shion"

msgctxt "1580_Shinada"

"So you wait for the guy to declare interest? What if they don't feel the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1616_Shinada"
msgid "Does that turn out well?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1628_Shion"
msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1640_Shion"
msgid ""
"I don't want a man who isn't comfortable enough to take the initiative to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1712_Shinada"
msgid "What languages?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1724_Shion"
msgid ""
"English and French. And I know enough Italian and German to get by without "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1736_Shinada"
msgid "That's amazing. That must come in handy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1748_Shion"

"Once you know basic grammar, it's just a matter of picking up vocabulary. "

msgctxt "1796_Shinada"
msgid "You can play the piano? I bet you've been taking lessons for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1808_Shion"
msgid ""
"Yes, but I stopped when I was in middle school. I'm actually not sure "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1820_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1832_Shion"
msgid "I may actually be better on the guitar than I am on the piano."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1844_Shinada"
msgid ""
"You play guitar? Whoa, I'd never have guessed! Are you in a band or "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1856_Shion"
msgid ""
"When I say guitar, I mean a nylon string acoustic. I learned musical styles "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1868_Shinada"
msgid "Oh, all right. I get you. Your dad sounds like he was a really cool guy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1880_Shion"
msgid "Quite! That's why I gave up the piano. I was too hooked on guitar."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1892_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1904_Shinada"

msgctxt "1916_Shion"

msgctxt "1928_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1940_Shion"
msgid "I see. Well... I suppose I feel I'm a bit too tall for a woman."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1952_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1964_Shion"
msgid "170 centimeters, exactly."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1976_Shinada"
msgid ""
"That is tall! But your body proportions are great, so I wouldn't worry. "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1988_Shion"
msgid "You really think so? Oh, you're just trying to butter me up!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2000_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2012_Shinada"
msgid "Got any quirks?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2024_Shion"
msgid "Oh no, my parents refined those out of me when I was a child."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2036_Shinada"
msgid "Yeah, that makes sense. I guess your family was a fairly strict one."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2048_Shion"
msgid ""
"Because of that, I'm fairly sensitive to the quirks of other people. I spot "
"them a lot in my customers while I'm talking to them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2060_Shion"
msgid ""
"Since they're involuntary habits, I suppose they can't be held accountable. "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2072_Shinada"
msgid "Do I have any?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2084_Shion"
msgid "Hmm. That's an interesting question."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2096_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2108_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2120_Shion"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2132_Shinada"
msgid "Mind telling me what your measurements are?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2144_Shion"
msgid ""
"Oh my! Shinada-san, have you been wondering that this whole time? I'm quite "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2156_Shinada"
msgid "What's wrong with that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2168_Shion"

msgctxt "2180_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2192_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Sorry, professional curiosity. You've just got such a great body, "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2204_Shion"
msgid "Well, I do take care to maintain my proportions."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2216_Shinada"
msgid ""
"I'll bet! You've got curves in all the right places and none where you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2228_Shion"
msgid "Oh, I wouldn't go that far! My measurements are 88, 59, 86."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "2240_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2252_Shinada"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2264_Shion"
msgid "What!?"
msgstr ""
