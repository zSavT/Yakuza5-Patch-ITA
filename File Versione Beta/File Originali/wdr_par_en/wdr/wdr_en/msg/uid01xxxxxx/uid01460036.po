msgctxt "140_Kiryu"

msgctxt "152_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I need to find girls who are ready and willing to work at Elise at a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "164_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"But with the recession, there's no one to hire. We can't find any girls in "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "176_Saejima"
msgid "So you're up a shit creek then."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "188_Shinada"
msgid ""
"I'd heard rumors, but man, that's rough. I heard lots of folks are leaving "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "200_Akiyama"
msgid "And that's exactly my point, Shinada-san."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "212_Shinada"
msgid "Wait, what'd I say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "224_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"If there are no top-tier hostesses to find in Kamurocho, then we need to "

msgctxt "236_Akiyama"

"My plan is to scout the whole country, and snag the number one hostess in "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "248_Saejima"
msgid "Good one."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "260_Kiryu"
msgid "You've put a lot of thought into this, I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "272_Shinada"
msgid ""
"But if that's your plan, why aren't you out there busting your ass scouting "
"right now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "284_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Well, I can't exactly scour the whole country by myself, you know? The club "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "296_Akiyama"
msgid "So, I need your help."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "308_Shinada"
msgid "Come again?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "320_Saejima"
msgid "Say what now?"

msgctxt "332_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Just hear me out! Kiryu-san can take "
"<Color:255,200,200,255>Fukuoka<Color:Default>, and Saejima-san can do "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "344_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I figured each of us would know a fair bit more about those cities than the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "356_Kiryu"
msgid "I get what you mean, but I think you're asking quite a lot of us."

msgctxt "368_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"We didn't come here today just so we could sign up to be your personal "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "380_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"I get it, but, if you have the time and inclination, please consider "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "392_Kiryu"
msgid "Hmm."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "404_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Think of it this way. If you visit a cabaret club in your city and happen "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "416_Saejima"
msgid "What's that even mean? The \"right girl\"?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Well, you're asking these girls to leave their lives behind to come to "

"You mean, like, <Color:255,200,200,255><Italic>know</Italic> her know "

msgctxt "452_Akiyama"
msgid "Well, I was trying to be subtle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Saejima"
msgid "Hmm."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "476_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"Of course, if you're already on good terms with a girl, even better. That "
"way you can invite her as soon as possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "488_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"If nothing else, I just need them for some temp work. Once my club is "
"making good money again, they can go back to their old lives."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "500_Akiyama"
msgid ""
"So, assuming you strike the right chord with a girl out there, they'll have "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "512_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"All right, I'm with you. I'm not happy about this city having lost its "
