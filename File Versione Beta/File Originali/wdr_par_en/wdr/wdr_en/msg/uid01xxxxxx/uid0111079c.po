"I don't, no. And it's not as if I'm from another place like you, "

"You're so kind! Heck, if I ran into that sort of situation, I'd probably "

"It's because I don't get to see my maternal grandmother since she's in "
"France, and my father's mother died when I was young. I try to help the "

msgctxt "200_Shion"

"In that case, I should walk around this neighborhood more often. That way I "

"Hey, it happens. These days, I don't think even locals know their town from "

msgctxt "272_Shion"

"But shouldn't we try to help for that very reason? Even if you take someone "

"Yeah, the cops aren't going to help a guy who's looking for some sex club, "

msgctxt "344_Shinada"

"Well, looking at a map is one thing, but as they say, seeing is believing. "
"You have to check places out in person."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "356_Shinada"
msgid ""
"You can try to make a point of checking out a new place each week. You "
