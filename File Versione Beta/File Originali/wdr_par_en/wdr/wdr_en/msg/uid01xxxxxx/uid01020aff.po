"Daigo told me the seventh Omi chairman isn't long for this world. And those "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "384_Baba"

"That's why some of the high-ranking Tojo guys went around drumming up "

msgid ""
"Lieutenant Azumi went to Nagoya, Majima-san took Sapporo, and Chairman "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "408_Kiryu"
msgid "But then Daigo went missing in Fukuoka..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "420_Kiryu"
msgid "Because of the betrayal... by Aoyama and Morinaga."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "432_Baba"
msgid ""
"Right. Their original plan was for Chairman Dojima to be executed, along "
"with Madarame, the head of the Yamagasa Family."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "444_Baba"
msgid ""
"But that plan failed. And after Chairman Dojima and Madarame both escaped, "
"Aoyama-san shifted gears."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "456_Kiryu"
msgid "He had some ideas of his own?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "468_Baba"
msgid "Oh, yeah. With Chairman Dojima missing, he tried to take over the Tojo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "480_Baba"
msgid ""
"But taking over was never the real mission that Aoyama-san and Morinaga "
"were tasked with."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "492_Baba"
msgid "Quite the opposite. The real mission was to sell out the Tojo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "504_Kiryu"
msgid "Sell it out? Hm. I think I can guess who the buyer was."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "516_Baba"
msgid "Yep. The Omi Alliance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "528_Baba"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "540_Kiryu"
msgid "Damn those guys..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "552_Baba"
msgid "They had two objectives."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "564_Baba"
msgid ""
"The first was to assassinate the Tojo leadership, like Chairman Dojima and "
"Majima-san. The other objective was－"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "576_Kiryu"
msgid "Me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "588_Baba"
msgid ""
"Yes. They were going to monitor former members, like you and Saejima-san, "
"and lure you back to Tokyo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Baba"
msgid "Once you arrived, the next step was to do you in, of course."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Kiryu"
msgid "But why make Tokyo their killing floor?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "624_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"They didn't need to do it here. In fact, it would've been easier to deal "
"with everyone separately."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "636_Baba"
msgid ""
"No, it did have to be here. As far as the Omi Alliance is concerned, the "
"Tojo Clan is built upon two legendary yakuza guys."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "648_Baba"
msgid ""
"Kazuma Kiryu and Taiga Saejima. The Dragon of Dojima, and the slayer of "
"eighteen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "660_Baba"
msgid "Removing the two of you would bring the Tojo Clan to its knees."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "672_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"By killing us both in Tokyo, they thought the whole clan would just be "
"theirs for the taking."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "684_Baba"
msgid "Yes, but not to exterminate it－to lead it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "696_Baba"
msgid "Do you see? They wanted more than Tojo turf. They wanted Tojo soldiers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "708_Baba"
msgid "All 30,000. That's why they wanted to avoid an all-out war."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "720_Baba"
msgid "Why kill their own future recruits?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "732_Kiryu"
msgid "Is Saejima already on his way to Tokyo?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "744_Baba"
msgid "Probably. I was with him up until we broke out of prison."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "756_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Sounds like you know each other pretty well. You two become close friends "
"or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "768_Baba"
msgid ""
"Well. You tend to bond when you do time together. Of course, I was planted "
"there as part of the plan."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "780_Kiryu"
msgid "I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Baba"
msgid "I was under the orders of the Omi Alliance, just like Aoyama and Morinaga."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "804_Baba"
msgid ""
"My role was to break Saejima-san out of prison, and make sure he was "
"motivated to investigate Majima-san's death."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "816_Baba"
msgid ""
"After the break-out, things were going according to plan. But somewhere "
"along the way, I... Um, I..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "828_Kiryu"
msgid "Saejima won you over, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "840_Baba"
msgid "...By the time we split up, I felt like I'd follow him anywhere."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "852_Baba"
msgid "That's why I'm here, talking to you and spilling the beans."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "864_Kiryu"
msgid "But whose beans are they?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "876_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"You say Omi is behind it, but their captain Watase didn't seem to know "
"anything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "888_Baba"
msgid ""
"To understand that, you have to know what's happening on the Omi side of "
"things."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "900_Kiryu"
msgid "I know that the factions are vying for the top spot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "912_Baba"
msgid "Okay, then. Moving on..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "924_Baba"
msgid ""
"After hearing that the seventh chairman was about to die, three families in "
"the alliance began maneuvering for the throne."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "936_Baba"
msgid ""
"The Watase Family, led by Captain Masaru Watase, is based in northern "
"Osaka. They have the most muscle."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "948_Baba"
msgid ""
"Lieutenant Hiroshi Takachi has his power base in Hyogo, and the seventh "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "960_Baba"
msgid ""
"And Naoki Katsuya heads Ousaka Enterprises, which has built an empire out "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "972_Baba"
msgid "Of the three, Watase is supposed to be the most likely successor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "984_Kiryu"
msgid "And yet, Watase isn't the type to get his hands dirty like this."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "996_Kiryu"
msgid "Meanwhile, Takachi died in Nagoya. That only leaves one person."
