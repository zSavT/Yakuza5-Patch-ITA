"The point of blackjack is to make the sum of your cards as close to 21 as "
"possible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "324"
msgid ""
"If your cards add up to 22 or more, you automatically lose. This is called "
"busting."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "336"
msgid ""
"The \"Total\" you see here displays the total of the cards you currently "
"have."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "348"
msgid ""
"When your total is 11 or less, it's impossible to bust, so you should "
"always draw an additional card."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "360"
msgid "Selecting \"Hit\" will draw a card."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "372"
msgid ""
"Double Down will also draw a card, but you'll have to play with the cards "
"in your hand at that point. You can also double your bet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "384"
msgid "Draw one more card by selecting Hit or Double Down."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "396"
msgid ""
"If you think you may go over 21 if you draw another card, select \"Stand\" "

"When you have two cards of the same value, you can perform a split. Try "
"selecting Split now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "432"
msgid ""
"Splitting allows you to separate your cards into two hands that you can "
"play simultaneously. The value of the bet also doubles."

msgctxt "444"
msgid ""
"The result of your game will be reflected in the chip count, as you see "
"here."

"The dealer's open card is an ace. If the second one is a 10, Jack, Queen, "

msgctxt "468"
msgid ""
"You'll most likely lose if the dealer gets blackjack, but you can lower "
"your risk by setting half the bet amount as insurance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "480"
msgid "Let's try using insurance this time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "492"
msgid "If your insurance bet succeeds, you'll make your original bet back."
