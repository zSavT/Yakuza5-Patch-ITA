msgctxt "456_Watase"

msgctxt "468_Watase"

msgctxt "480_Kiryu"

msgctxt "576_Watase"

msgctxt "588_Kiryu"
msgid "What?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "600_Watase"
msgid ""
"I'm gonna need to fight the Tojo sooner or later if I wanna control this "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "612_Watase"

msgctxt "756_Watase's Subordinate"

msgctxt "768_Kiryu"

msgctxt "780_Watase's Subordinate"
