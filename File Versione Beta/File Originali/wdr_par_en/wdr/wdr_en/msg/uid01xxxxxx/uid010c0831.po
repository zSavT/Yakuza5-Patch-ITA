msgctxt "224_Clean Cut Man"

msgctxt "248_Muranaka"

msgctxt "308_Kiryu"
msgid "Sorry. You just looked the type that doesn't take their job very seriously."

msgctxt "320_Clean Cut Man"
msgid ""
"Wow. And there's the double punch. Well, I do try not to be too formal with "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "332_Clean Cut Man"
msgid ""
"It can put the interview subjects on edge, so I opt for a more casual "

msgctxt "344_Kiryu"
msgid "Interview?"

msgctxt "356_Clean Cut Man"

"Oh, sorry for not introducing myself. I'm a freelance writer. The name's "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "368_Kiryu"
msgid "Ah. A freelance writer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "380_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Well, I guess a lot of us freelance writers work part-time, so you weren't "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "392_Kiryu"
msgid "Are you a freelance writer?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "404_Clean Cut Man"
msgid ""
"Wow! You got it in one guess! You're pretty good at sizing people up, all "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "416_Kiryu"
msgid "Interview?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "428_Clean Cut Man"
msgid ""
"Oh, sorry for not introducing myself. The name's Muranaka. And I'm a "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "440_Kiryu"
msgid "Why are you interviewing taxi drivers?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "452_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"I believe variety is the spice of life. I meet all sorts of people in my "
"job, but I figured taxi drivers would have even more perspective."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "464_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"So I've been interviewing cabbies all over the country to hear their "
"stories. I'm putting together an article on it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "476_Kiryu"
msgid "I see. How are the interviews going?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "488_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Well, I've interviewed a few drivers already, but all they want to do is "
"boast about the big tips they got back during the bubble economy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "500_Muranaka"
msgid "Do you have any stories that stand out in particular? It can be anything."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "512_Kiryu"
msgid "(Something that stands out, huh?)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "524_Kiryu"
msgid "Well, not long after I started this job, I was given a 50,000 yen tip."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "536_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Okay, here we go again. Let me guess, this was back during the bubble "
"economy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "548_Kiryu"
msgid "No, it was six months ago."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Only recently? Wait, you mean you've only just started this job? Aren't you "
"a little old to be starting a whole new career like that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Kiryu"
msgid "Perhaps."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "584_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Wow! What triggered the change? To be honest, I'm more interested in that "
"than the 50,000 yen."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "596_Kiryu"
msgid "(I don't get these writer types.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "608_Kiryu"
msgid "I'd rather not dig up the past."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "620_Muranaka"
msgid "Oh, I see. That's a shame."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "632_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"But it's my policy to not press too hard when someone doesn't want to talk "
"about something. I'll leave it at that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Kiryu"
msgid "I guess the first day I did this job is what sticks out in my memory."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Muranaka"
msgid "I see. Memories of your first day as a driver."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I'm not from around here, so I wasn't confident I could navigate properly. "
"It was nerve-wracking not knowing if I'd reach the destination."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "680_Kiryu"
msgid "Anyway, I finally got my first passenger."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"It turned out to be an elementary school boy who'd never ridden in a taxi "
"before."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"He brought a map showing the way to his grandmother's house, which helped "
"me a lot."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Muranaka"
msgid "I see. So it was a first for both of you. He must have been nervous."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Yes. But after he had paid and got out, he looked so much more grown up to "
"me than when he first got in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Kiryu"
msgid "It motivated me to knuckle down and be brave, just like that little kid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Muranaka"
msgid "......"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Kiryu"
msgid "(Huh? Maybe he's not that interested.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Muranaka"
msgid "That's a great story, driver! I'd love to write about it in my article!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Kiryu"
msgid "You're welcome to."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Kiryu"
msgid "(I'm glad I could give him some good material.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Kiryu"
msgid "Nothing really stands out to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Muranaka"
msgid "Oh, I see. But surely there's something you can tell me about?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Kiryu"
msgid "No, nothing really comes to mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Okay. I just thought a driver like you might have a unique perspective on "
"things. Never mind."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Kiryu"
msgid "(I should have given it a bit more thought.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "872_Kiryu"
msgid "I don't suppose you have any inside stories on the taxi industry, do you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "884_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Things that are ordinary for people in your line of work, but not well "
"known by others."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Kiryu"
msgid "(Let me see...)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "908_Kiryu"
msgid "You know the light on the roof of taxis?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "920_Muranaka"
msgid "Yes. The one with the company name on it, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "932_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"They usually aren't switched on unless the taxi is empty, but you can make "
"them blink red to warn others in an emergency."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "944_Muranaka"
msgid "Wow, really!? I never knew that! Where is the switch that makes them blink?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "956_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I'm afraid I can't tell you that. It's somewhere you can push without "
"alerting the passenger."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Muranaka"
msgid "Oh, now I'm curious. But I think I could still use this in my article!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Kiryu"
msgid "(I'm glad I could give him some good material.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Kiryu"
msgid "Do you know what happens to the meter when you reverse in a taxi?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Muranaka"
msgid "No, I don't! What does it do? Does the meter go down or something?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"No, that wouldn't make sense. When you shift into reverse the meter treats "
"it the same as when you are stopped."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Muranaka"
msgid "So if you went the whole way in reverse, you could go anywhere for free!?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Well, there aren't any roads you could do that on. And when you're stopped, "
"the meter still goes up based on time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"Oh, so it'll still cost you. Hmm, I think I could turn that into something "
"for my article, though. Thanks!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064_Kiryu"
msgid "(I'm glad I could give him some good material.)"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"I could tell you about taxi jargon. That said, I haven't been doing this "
"long, so these are just things I've heard from my colleagues."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088_Muranaka"
msgid "I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Kiryu"
msgid "A flag is someone who flags you down on the street."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Kiryu"
msgid "A bingo is someone who flags you down when you already have a passenger."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Muranaka"
msgid "Uh-huh."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Kiryu"
msgid "Drivers sometimes call in bingos so another taxi can come and pick them up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Muranaka"
msgid "I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Kiryu"
msgid "Are you not that interested in this?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Muranaka"
msgid "No, it's interesting, for sure."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Muranaka"
msgid ""
"But because these aren't terms you use yourself, I can't figure out an "
"angle for my article."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1196_Kiryu"
msgid "(I guess I should have spoken from experience.)"
msgstr ""
