msgctxt "84_Shinada"

msgctxt "132_Shinada"

msgctxt "168_High School Batter"
msgid "Huh? Who are you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "180_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Oh, nobody special. Just your average, uh... men's health journalist who "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "192_High School Batter"
msgid ""
"Oh snap! I know what that is. So do you, like, get to go to massage parlors "
"all the time? That sounds like the best job in the world!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "204_Shinada"
msgid ""
"It's honestly not that great. I mean, I do go to get my muscle tussled "
"quite often, but－ Hey, that's not what I'm here to talk about!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "216_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Look, I noticed you were talking to yourself about training.\r\n"
"I used to be quite the slugger myself, back in my day. If\r\n"
"you'd like, I'd be happy to give you some pointers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "276_High School Batter"
msgid ""
"Well... I'm just conflicted. See, my coach told me to learn how to foul "
"pitches off."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "288_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Oh, yeah. He wants you to learn how to cut away pitches you don't like and "
"run up the pitch count."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "300_High School Batter"
msgid ""
"Yeah, well. I'm our team's cleanup hitter, but my stats after two strikes "
"are terrible."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "312_High School Batter"
msgid ""
"I get psyched out by the pitcher, I swing at bad throws, and I have a pile "
"of strikeouts to show for it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "324_High School Batter"
msgid ""
"Coach has had enough, and he's talking about dropping me from the starting "
"lineup unless I can get it together."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "336_Shinada"
msgid ""
"So that's why he wants you to learn how to hit fouls. He's not wrong, you "
"know."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "348_Shinada"
msgid ""
"When a batter gets behind on the count, his ability to foul off pitches "
"really makes a difference."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "360_Shinada"
msgid ""
"For instance, if you have two strikes against, being able to foul off the "
"pitcher's best throws will annoy him while you wait for a chance."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "372_High School Slugger"
msgid ""
"I can understand that, but it seems so cheesy. It's tough to get into that "
"mindset."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "384_Shinada"
msgid ""
"What's tough about it? Cutting fouls takes a lot of technique. You have to "
"be an expert at controlling your swing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "396_Shinada"
msgid ""
"Think about batting like a chess match between you and the pitcher. Your "
"cutting technique is just another tool in your arsenal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "408_Shinada"
msgid ""
"By fouling off pitches, you can negate the pitcher's best stuff and narrow "
"down his pitching choices. Which puts pressure on the guy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "420_Shinada"
msgid ""
"You could say that having the ability to cut makes a batter all the more "
"dangerous."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "432_High School Slugger"
msgid "Oh. I get it now. That's why. But how am I supposed to learn how to cut?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "444_Shinada"
msgid ""
"This might be an oversimplification, but I try to draw a bead on the ball, "
"and swing a split second early. It's like jumping the gun."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "456_High School Slugger"
msgid "Could I maybe get you to give me a demonstration?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "480_High School Slugger"
msgid ""
"Hmm, I suppose I could do that. Just watch, I'll hit three fouls out of ten "
"throws."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "492_High School Slugger"
msgid "That would be great! Thank you!"
