msgctxt "308_Kiryu"

msgctxt "536_Nakajima"

"If she came outta that coma, I wanted to be ready to take her on another "

msgctxt "548_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"But then I figured after that accident, she'd be too scared to do that "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "560_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"So I thought if I became a taxi driver and learned safe drivin', maybe "
"she'd be okay with it. Maybe we could go back to old times, just the two of "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "572_Nakajima"

msgctxt "656_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"If Onisaka-san knew about this, I'm sure he'd forgive you for going back on "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "668_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"No. I didn't want to use my wife as an excuse. And I just couldn't face up "

msgctxt "680_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"I'm a former racer myself, so I know exactly how he feels. I know how much "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "692_Kiryu"
msgid "Yeah, but..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "704_Nakajima"
msgid "If I told him about the accident, sure, he'd probably let it slide."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"But think about what that'd do to him. Cars have been his life. I don't "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Nakajima"
msgid "I don't think tellin' him's a good idea."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Kiryu"
msgid "So you want Onisaka to keep on racing, then?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"I used to want that. I figured with me off the road, he might as well do "
"enough racin' for the both of us."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"But now I don't know. He's gettin' old. I don't want him chained to this "
"life until it's too late. One day he'll push it too far."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"And when he bows out, I want it to be at the right time... I don't want him "
"to end up like me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Nakajima"
msgid ""
"Now, if someone were to beat him in a race, maybe that'd give him what he "
"needs to lay his pride down..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Kiryu"
msgid "Then that's what I'll do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Nakajima"
msgid "Huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Kiryu"
msgid "I'll challenge Onisaka-san and put an end to his career."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Nakajima"
msgid "You'd... You'd do that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "848_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Sure. Back when I was lost, you gave me a place and a purpose. That's "
"always meant a lot to me... so let me pay you back."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Nakajima"
msgid "But that's askin' too much..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "872_Kiryu"
msgid ""
"Nakajima-san, listen. I've taken down all the Devil Killers. And now I'm "
"the fastest in Fukuoka, just like you were."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "884_Kiryu"
msgid "It's my turn to step up and race in your stead. You leave this to me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "896_Nakajima"
msgid "Suzuki-san..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "908_Nakajima"
msgid "...Thank you."
