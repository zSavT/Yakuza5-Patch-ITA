msgctxt "632_Kotani"
msgid "Oh. Well. Let's just move on to the next question, I suppose."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "644_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I would give up and let my friend have him. Friendship is more important to "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "656_Kotani"
msgid ""
"But what if you really, really like this boy? And do friendships last all "

msgctxt "668_Haruka"
msgid "Maybe, but I still couldn't betray my friend. That just wouldn't be me."

msgctxt "680_Kotani"

msgctxt "704_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Hehe. Well, aren't you sweet? I think I might be becoming a new fan of "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "716_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I would go after the boy myself and not worry about my friend. I have to "
"follow my own heart."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "728_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Hmm. That makes you sound a little love-hungry, I'd say. Do you think your "
"agency would be okay with you saying that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "740_Haruka"
msgid "I don't know. It's just how I honestly feel."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "752_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Hmm. Maybe that's just how young people these days think. I suppose too "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "764_Kotani"
msgid ""
"However, I'm not sure an answer like that will make you very popular with "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "776_Haruka"
msgid "I see."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "788_Haruka"
msgid "I would ask my friend to give up and let me have him."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "800_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Really!? Do you think your friend would even agree to do that? Wouldn't it "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "812_Haruka"
msgid "Well, if I sincerely explain how I feel, I think she might understand."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "824_Kotani"
msgid ""
"I suppose if she wasn't a very assertive girl, she might give him up for "
"you. But wouldn't you feel bad?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "836_Kotani"

"After all, a cute girl like you could get any boy you wanted. Wouldn't you "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "860_Haruka"

msgctxt "872_Haruka"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "884_Kotani"
msgid ""
"\"My boyfriend is shy. We've been going out for six months, but we've still "

msgctxt "932_Kotani"
msgid "Hmph. I suppose just try to do better on the next one."

msgctxt "944_Haruka"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "956_Kotani"
msgid "Oh my! You're quite bold, aren't you, Haruka-chan?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "968_Haruka"
msgid ""
"I just believe that if you want something to happen, sometimes the best "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "980_Kotani"
msgid "Ah. I like your way of thinking. It's very refreshing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "992_Kotani"
msgid "But doesn't it take a lot of courage for a girl to make the first move?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1004_Haruka"
msgid "Maybe so. But sometimes a girl just needs to be brave."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1016_Kotani"
msgid ""
"That's a pretty brazen thing for an idol to say. I imagine the reactions "
"will be mixed, but I'll try to give it a favorable slant."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1028_Haruka"
msgid ""
"You should keep waiting. That's not the kind of thing you should hurry. And "
"besides, what does it matter what other people are doing?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1040_Kotani"
msgid ""
"I can understand the feeling of not wanting to fall behind the other girls. "
"Being worried your friends are going to make fun of you is quite "
"distressing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1052_Haruka"
msgid ""
"But if you really like him, then you should wait for it to happen "
"naturally. Why worry about what other girls might say?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1064_Kotani"
msgid ""
"What a very mature and well-considered answer. It sounds like you'd make "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1076_Kotani"
msgid ""
"I know it's hard not to succumb to peer pressure, but I bet you've helped "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1088_Haruka"
msgid "Thank you very much!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1100_Haruka"
msgid "How about trying to set the mood to entice him to kiss you?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1112_Kotani"
msgid "Set the mood how?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1124_Haruka"
msgid ""
"For example, you could touch his arm or his knee, cuddle in close, turn "
"your face toward his, and close your eyes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1136_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Hold on! That sounds a little like what a hostess bar girl would do! Are "
"you really recommending that to our readers?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1148_Haruka"
msgid "Oh, I'm sorry. Is that bad?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1160_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Well, not necessarily. It's just that it was such an unexpected answer. "
"That's great for my article, though!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1172_Haruka"
msgid ""
"All right, here's the last question. It's a pretty serious one. It's from "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1184_Kotani"
msgid ""
"\"My friend has been seeing her teacher, who is married with children. I "

msgctxt "1328_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Yes, but the friend is obviously thinking with her heart and not her head. "
"Do you think she'll take heed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1340_Kotani"
msgid ""
"Plus, she might not have even known he was married until after she had "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1352_Haruka"

"Maybe, but once she does know, she has to break up with him. That kind of "
