"The kid's Mikasa-kun. He's a freshman, but with big hopes on him－he's "

msgctxt "456_Shinada"

msgctxt "468_Kotetsu"

"Man... That's pretty flattering to hear in this day and age. How can I say "

msgctxt "648_Kotetsu"

msgctxt "780_Shinada"
msgid "Sure, whatever. I mean, what's in it for me if I win?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "792_Kotetsu"
msgid ""
