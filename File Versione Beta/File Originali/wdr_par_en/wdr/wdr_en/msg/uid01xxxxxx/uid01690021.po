msgctxt "1916_Saejima"
msgid "Alright. So what do I do?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1928_Sakurai"
msgid ""
"First, your clothing. Hm... Actually, what you're wearing right now should "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1952_Sakurai"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1964_Saejima"
msgid "How do I get those?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "1976_Sakurai"
msgid ""
"I'll draw you a map. But food might be a problem. It's hard enough for the "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "1988_Saejima"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2228_Nishina"
msgid ""
"In fact, I don't know where he came from. One of our hunters found him in "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2240_Nishina"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2276_Nishina"
msgid ""
"I heard he went to the mountain this morning. Is it because the monster was "

msgstr ""

msgctxt "2288_Saejima"
msgid "Monster?"

msgctxt "2300_Nishina"

msgctxt "2360_Saejima"

msgctxt "2396_Nishina"
